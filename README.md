Iplo Analysis
=============

Analyzing differences in word use between people groups or prominent figures is a common task in modern data-driven journalism.

Many sources, however, use naive methods that produce spurious results.

Iplo, the ***I****nformative* ***P****rior* ***L****og* ***O****dds Ratio* method, is attested in research as being highly 
useful for determining which words are representative of the differences between the language use of two groups.

This precise, complex method produces high-quality distinctions through probabilistic methods and large text corpora.

We believe we are the first to bring Iplo from research to the click of a button.

Uses
====
By simply:

1. Copying and pasting text into two boxes, (say, the Republican text and the Democratic text), or
2. inputting the twitter handles of 2 people to compare, or
3. uploading 2 `.txt` files to compare,

one can harness the illuminating power of Iplo. We automatically determine salient 2-word phrases to be included in the analysis, and report:

1. A graph of the most heavily biased words for each population, and
2. A list of words and their Iplo scores, which can be used in further analysis.

Docs

This is a flask app. It uses Python.
