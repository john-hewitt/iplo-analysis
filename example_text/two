system  whether they buy insur or not and i like that becaus i the presid and most of the news peopl it allow peopl with pre exist condit to get health insur the abil for low incom famili that dont qualifi for medicaid to be abl to buy into the medicaid system it import that peopl have health insur i think it a posit   becaus that health care is not more avail becaus im a diabet and i just retir

thing is perfect yet it is an attempt in the right direct  everybodi should have health insur health care for everyon everybodi need health care and this is a way to get it  it good for everyon to have health insur i think everi civil countri has a good health system other then the us it for everybodi  no one can be left out coverag for a number of peopl i think of some of area that are uninsur they cant have pre exist condit i think it an advantag for peopl with no insur and it more afford and practic eventu the law will univers coverag becaus it allow peopl that werent abl to get insur to be abl to get insur  i do think there should be good health care for everi individu   servic peopl can afford and everyon is elig to have servic the price of and everyth in general everybodi should have insur health care well it go to get the young peopl and the older peopl what they want  it import for peopl that cant afford health care includ young peopl get good coverag and afford and for the poor too everyon should have coverag becaus uninsur peopl need to be insur  all the countri in the world you can step into a hospit and be taken care of  in this countri you peopl cant afford medic cost not everyon get health care becaus i believ everyon need health insur becaus it begin to make health care more access to greater number of peopl  if it for everybodi health it good i think we need to start the extrem and all our citizen  so that the uninsur will have and uninsur for themselv   i have  i need someth this isnt exist becaus a lot of peopl didnt like pre exist condit of peopl insur put them in debt they were thing i like becaus im a veteran and i dont have to deal with it becaus if i want to start a busi i can get health insur now becaus of the term and what they would be do is someth i havent been abl get so im go to need this peopl will have health insur and no pre exist condit  access to insur even if you have it pre exist becaus i know a lot of peopl who couldnt afford health insur  a lot of peopl would retir but they cant becaus they cant afford insur think that all peopl should have health care not just congress i just think everyon need health insur  opportun for all peopl to have coverag becaus it provid health care to a lot of peopl who wouldnt it otherwis everybodi should be equal becaus they dont and i have cancer  and they me someon to help me it will make my heath insur and it will go down  i think it peopl who do not have insur that need it becaus i feel like everybodi is entitl to health insur i think everyon should have insur and if you cant afford it have  it veri cost but you have to have someth otherwis die if you cant get medic  it afford we should have health care for everyon in this countri i trust the presid the coverag  has someth similar becaus peopl without insur can get it now help out other peopl in the countri hope make thing better for me my daughter my two children and about other famili member need insur becaus i think it will help out all class of peopl i think more peopl should pay for their insur think it a good law and the unit state need it give everybodi access to health care  serious health care issu can get health care  this would provid peopl without health care to have option  i feel like everyon is entitl to health care  i think it will reduc cost when peopl go to a doctor offic instead of the emerg room  i have a famili member who has previous medic condit and requir insur and the price otherwis it will be too expens i just realli feel that a littl money use to help peopl in our own countri instead of start at home first  it societi need to take care of each other it allow to peopl who havent had insur to get insur uninsur peopl would have a way to get health insur  a lot of work peopl that dont have insur  there a gap i person think that health care need to be univers   the health insur compani run this countri   this give everyon a to have health insur  i think it good for everyon expand access to health care  health insur for more peopl  im guess it just the mean of reach out toward other   im a law student  learn more about that becaus more peopl in the countri should be elig for health care  well i got health insur when i didnt have ani becaus year the rise cost of health care has bankrupt the countri   at least we are tri to do someth  i believ that in this countri should have insur it not all bad there good part to it i feel like the the bad part onli  work with societi or benefit other in this countri everybodi should be entitl to health care i get coverag for pre exist condit i had a and had no insur and sign to get insur to have the surgeri it requir peopl to have health insur or pay a penalti but most peopl would benefit from have insur think that underprivileg peopl should have insur it a good option for low incom famili the employ have to give me insur that so mani peopl were left out of the other system  peopl with pre exist condit and need to go to the doctor couldnt and use the emerg room  that is not cost effect at all  we need major reform  there isnt anyth that hard  we can reach as long as we are given an opportun obama sometim you have drop coverag becaus someth need to be done  the and the abil for more peopl to get coverag and the rule provid coverag for peopl that would not have insur other wise i think it will be good in the long run for american coverag of pre exist condit and coverag for everyon be avail to more peopl we live in a countri that can more than afford to take care of it peopl after weve been taken advantag of by health care compani  we need to get it to a point where everyon can afford health care well it a step in the right direct  becaus i think that a wealthi countri should provid access to univers health care for it citizen and not deni coverag for pre exist condit  becaus i have a job and i can provid health insur for me and my famili peopl that are least fortun can have health care the law is suppos to help peopl that need help and im guess the law help them when it need i can stay with my parent insur the main reason to have coverag for everyon  it just afford i believ it is the begin of a nation health care system that will allow all american afford health care  i believ in univers health care elimin of pre exist condit  it also allow to not be discrimin against pre exist condit  it also make it afford for famili as tax  one thing good about it extend health benefit to a lot of famili that did it an embarrass to be the onli countri without univers health care that way it give everyon the opportun to have insur i think it go to  free the work man and give peopl a chanc to experi america becaus i believ that it is a step in the right direct and should be tri person with my incom level will now qualifi for health insur as far as my understand it give our low incom famili in the countri a chanc at health care to get attent for all kind of sick becaus with the insur i got the doctor see me that the main thing  becaus i think that more peopl should have access to afford insur and with pre exist condit i depend on the doctor becaus im under 25 and need health insur i was laid off this year and hope get a rate becaus we are out 30 nation in and 25 out 30 nation in for my employe it seem to be someth they can afford  i do believ access to health care is import  no cap  and that they cant hold it against you for have a pre exist condit  becaus peopl who make low incom need to have insur becaus i believ the health care is right for everyon and everyon should have health care we have a health payment system  it a quick attempt to get someth in place with far less than it ought to be in the first place the health system when we are sick have a health insur give health care for everyon everybodi should be entitl to health care becaus everybodi need health insur   got peopl with medic coverag that didnt have it befor give everyon an opportun to have health care becaus there is too mani peopl who dont have a way of pay for their health care without go bankrupt becaus we have noth and someth is better then noth  we have to start somewher  it definit need to be reform there is lot of peopl that dont have health coverag so that a lot of peopl will benefit from it  i think the health reform is a good thing a long time come afford health care that i can use well becaus mani of peopl have not been abl to afford insur and reject for disabl  becaus ive been without insur befor and i see it as help everybodi  it a good thing basic anyth that will help the i am favor of becaus someth had to be done to fix the big problem it help societi a better place too much becaus i know mani mani peopl  senior and younger  who do not have insur  and they will be cover  and a lot have life diseas and they will be cover  i can continu to be on my parent insur becaus of the law becaus it will help more peopl health care for everybodi all the peopl can have health insur peopl dont have insur and when they are sick they cant afford to go to the doctor becaus they dont have insur  it a good thing for everyon to have so they can be healthi i think we need nation health care insur pre exist condit peopl are not be deni for no reason the health care need to be overhaul  need to be save becaus no one can be deni becaus pre exist condit provid health care for those who cant get health care it will help peopl who dont have insur i am on disabl so i am in favor of it and health care is hard come by becaus i make onli a certain amount of money it a good thing it just make thing seem a littl bit easier too mani peopl without insur  without ani other resourc and peopl with insur are pay for them  becaus all american should have the right for afford health care becaus it provid provis for peopl who had exist health condit that can now get coverag and i feel that is veri import i believ it make health care more afford  parent can keep kid on insur until 26  can not deni someon becaus pre exist condit it doe give health coverag to a lot of peopl who didnt have it  i believ it good  it afford for peopl most of the will be abl to have better health insur that cover more compar to what they had befor so that i can see if i can get the medicaid peopl with mental health issu are abl to receiv care without a job anyth that expand coverag i am self employ and i think it good to have extra option out there and you think it a good idea for peopl to have health insur i like it becaus it provid health care for children becaus i feel that everybodi deserv health care the presid know what he is do  i think it a good step to the futur with everyon have a form of health care it veri import  it necessari to have health insur they took away the pre exist condit  we have not been deni health care becaus it give health care to more peopl  i think it a step in right direct well i use  im on medicar now  i am a diabet  went 18 month without with insur  becaus that mean peopl that couldnt have insur befor can have it now becaus there are chang that need to be chang and the fund that are set for health care it just give an opportun for folk that are uninsur over time it will control cost it easier to obtain health insur for everyon  will help with the economi and the deficit it doe  it exclud more peopl becaus our current health system doesnt work what happen is a lot of peopl are sick and they have no coverag and they appli for medicaid and dont know if they will be approv provid insur benefit for those in need too mani peopl are go to the emerg room overal good for the peopl i is will be use when you need to see a doctor there should be some form of nation insur plan and make it easier for folk to get insur unafford health insur  greater access to health care for all incom becaus i never had a problem glad those who did not have ani health care have option becaus i think that peopl that cant afford health care have an opportun to health care  for peopl that have limit incom it do what we should have been do along time ago  it will provid servic we should have had i am a manag of a and now all employe can afford health insur it will help peopl without insur and in the long run everyon would not pay for emerg room primari care the insur compani have a veri broken system and that i would hope that the feder run would run to provid good rate   i like what it doe so far overal  it would help peopl who cant afford it becaus the obama care system is still not up i think everybodi need to have health insur i think it a great idea take away from our right to pick our own plan  health care for everyon the pre exist condit and insur compani were make rule for that becaus it go to cover the american that current dont have insur it is design to help mani who are uninsur to be come insur peopl with pre exist condit will be cover becaus it help all the peopl who dont have health care it better than noth be done at all the no pre exist ill becaus the previous system and the system we have now is so broken  i dont see with it can hurt the fact that it requir larg compani to provid health care polici too mani peopl are sick and die  go without their medic  someon who has been without health insur for the past 5 year  it was nice to get insur and without on health care  necessari for the public welfar everybodi need health care everyon deserv health care   and it cover pre exist condit univers health care the servic when you go to the doctor you get becaus i think it import and the govern actual realiz that health care is import it benefit me im glad peopl with pre exist condit can get insur  it for the poor  im realli  it doesnt realli bother me   i dont need that type of help  i think everyon should have access to medic care and i wouldnt mind pay a bit more to help other afford health care becaus we have more control over us  more prevent becaus mani  mani million of american dont have health insur i think it go to give regular peopl who cant afford health insur a chanc to get health insur  everybodi can have health insur and that is a good thing provid coverag for those who arent cover becaus everybodi that couldnt afford health care can now afford it of all thing to take care of for peopl first it should be health care   it is not fair to base health care on how much peopl make or how much they can afford  my is the shit it are good  it want to do good but i think the thing im struggl with is everyth with congress is a mess now everybodi get insur need to thing out peopl need health care and dont have ani i believ everyon should have insur they made lot of chang and it came from obama and trust him poor peopl need insur too  access and afford for health care for those who do not get  some peopl cant afford it coverag for young adult that anyon can have now health insur it necessari i think that a lot of peopl need health care but cant afford it and i think it a good idea for the less fortun better becaus peopl have insur   dont have to spend that much time to wait to see a doctor a lot peopl have been benefit of the new health care law i like it becaus give peopl a chanc that cant afford it tri to help peopl my opinion is that everyon cannot afford insur and i have seen peopl turn away from the hospit and peopl treat and home becaus they did not have insur i like that it provid health insur coverag for everyon becaus i believ that everybodi should have insur  it give everybodi the chanc to have health care the salud the health i like that it provid access to a portion of the popul that is current uninsur  becaus there is so mani peopl that didnt have insur that can now have it everybodi need health care i believ that it is do a lot of thing to help peopl without access to health care  becaus it provid everyon access to health insur it provid health care for a lot that did not have it it help peopl who need help with their health care  it provid health care for everyon it is good for american who should have a health care option if they have lost their job look out for the small like your husband  he work for small busi it is embarrass that the us is the onli countri that doe not have univers health care chang where there is no restrict on previous health condit  all peopl will be abl to have insur and afford it i think in general it provid health care for more american  and elimin pre condit that stop peopl from get insur someth need to be done favor opinion becaus it would make insur compani pay for prevent health care and would be hard for them to deni coverag  everybodi should have health insur  there is no reason not to it good for peopl who dont have ani coverag  poor peopl    depend could be cover up until age 26 i think it is that our countri wealthi as our cant afford health care   i think we need to provid for peopl that cant afford it  more peopl be cover becaus they ensur hospit dont refus peopl base on medic condit i think we need health care for everyon gave my son health insur for a more year becaus health insur is too expens for the peopl and they cant afford it  i believ it someth everyon need to have in order to have some form of health care becaus their are so mani peopl lack basic health care  especi children i feel like someon need to do someth about health care  and someon is do someth about it  the fact that there tri to do someth help poor peopl that need it i feel like everyon should be entitl for health care becaus peopl who dont have insur and are work should be pay for it  this is suppos to be the best countri in the world and smaller countri have better care and we need to be help some of the poorer peopl in the unit state pay some of it  health coverag is becaus we need more health reform i think it a good direct for everyon     becaus i need the health insur i think it make health care more afford for peopl  pay some of medic bill  it could lead to them get on to the pharmaceut compani becaus we are i just want to see more peopl who cant afford it get more health care with 30 million peopl with no health insur that is it about time poor peopl get a break in america everi countri should have health insur  all of the other countri do but the us i am that it cover my adult children so that they can support themselv  well we need to do someth and this is the step in the right direct  peopl who havent been abl to afford it have more option now im a medic student and everybodi should be insur i have a favor opinion becaus it affect me  i have kid so i need to make sure we are cover  i want other to have insur also  just becaus they dont have a lot of money they should still i just like the idea of it  son has bad diseas think it would help my situat becaus everyon will have it and it wont cost me an and a well it has onli taken year to obtain it  the entir thing is good veri fair way they oper   too much they need to stop that it ridicul   as i understand it  all american are go to be requir to purchas health insur  i think it should be true and they should cut out medicaid  i dont think govern should be involv in hous it allow you to insur your children longer  it provid care for more peopl  peopl need health care and be healthi as a nation everybodi can use a health care plan  with this plan peopl are more abl to one becaus i thought it would help peopl without health insur  i thought it would give them some health coverag if they where not work it provid wonder opportun and insur for everyon  opportun to out someth that in theyr incom that they can afford i think it is import for peopl who have health care  if you cant pay for your health bill they will for you i think it is about time the unit state has health insur coverag for everyon  i think everyon has the right to afford health insur  with this health care reform law peopl will be abl to have insur for less cost get closer to nation health care  it didnt get us there   wish it had gone further  i feel that the republican are out to destroy medicar and i feel that this plan will help keep medicar and social secur in check  the republican want to kill medicar off becaus it would help a lot of peopl but not for a few year yet  it would help peopl who dont have the resourc to afford health care becaus i think we need a reform and someth to take care of the poor and the elder i do think everybodi need insur of some sort but i dont think they should forc peopl to have it and if they could make it afford for everybodi to get it that would be a veri good thing  sound like everybodi will be elig for coverag at low cost becaus i am not have ani problem with my health care and my cost associ with it i think everi one should have health insur i think it is better for the major and there would more coverag for more peopl at a better rate i think it is need    health care is more afford   total support presid obama peopl who dont have insur would be more accept by insur compani it hasnt cost me anyth in ani way and i havent seen ani chang in my medicar that would affect me i believ it is the first step toward a total reform of the health care system in the us  it a busi  through mean everyon is in to help everyon  i think all american should have afford health care becaus i believ it protect the uninsur and under insur  that the basic i think that everyon in the countri should have insur as good as my own  which is medicar   it has serv all my need  i think everybodi need health insur  i think it would be good if everyon had avail health care becaus befor the health reform it was a mess and this take some step to put some sens into the health care law  were all one major ill away from bankruptci  from the insur becaus our health care system in our countri is broken  that everi from medicar to privat sector are direct by it about time we had that law   we need to help the poor peopl  i think everyon should have health care  we didnt have anyth as far as a requir coverag befor that didnt have to pay and were uninsur  if you insur it will pay the rest of it it protect my health insur becaus i cant lose it and they cant me as long as health care is there i am okay with it  as long as it is fair to everyon it is okay  we are we are american becaus everyon will get it  that even poor peopl will have insur without health care reform  most peopl will not be abl to afford health care  except for the rich thing it is what i hope is one of the mani step to nation health care and i believ that health care is one of the right that the were to when they the constitut  health care is cost way too much money and unless we get a on it it go to bring our countri down   i think that the insur compani arent serv our nation well and they it give peopl health insur that do not have insur  help peopl with health if they need it just to make health care avail for most peopl from what i know of it i feel like it good for peopl with low incom  it just seem that way  we wont have to pay as much for medicin and stuff like that  all other countri have govern run health care  the u s  is the onli countri like it becaus it give the peopl who have not previous had insur the poor need the help i went through some stuff with my that univers health insur would have help a lot  it was the lack of insur that hurt the  i feel that it someth that we need in our countri up till this point we havent had much of a bill  it not perfect but we on the right path becaus no pre condit keep you from access your health care  it doe not cut medicar and medicaid  i think that it is good that the govern has someth in place to take care of the peopl everyon cant get your inform more peopl would have afford health insur   becaus insur is out of reach  for some peopl and for employ peopl and benefit are expens the cost of health care too high so that peopl who cannot afford medic treatment can have it   i realli think that the whole thing is head in the right direct i live in new and everyth is high so with the new law i think we will be better off and everyon should and deserv to have insur  it extend coverag to more peopl take off the in a lifetim  and no pre  exist condit to insur i have been unemploy year and i have no health care and the job i

your parent insur from what i see the law is veri promis  i think overal they are look for the best for the american peopl those who are not cover will now be abl to receiv coverag mucha gent que no a lo an  mani peopl that not been abl to obtain insur now if the un was unabl to obtain  becaus i think all peopl in the u s  should be abl to afford health insur lot a peopl that need insur cant afford it that most peopl are cover and it not a bill or bill  some effort make a differ i think we need someth instead of noth  that there more peopl to have access to insur  i peopl who are unabl to afford privat health insur should have it becaus it would help them    i think they can do better than what they are do becaus it will make health care to million who dont have it right now    becaus it doe help peopl who have insur and peopl who dont have coverag  peopl need health insur everybodi need health insur  money is  so everi littl bit that we can get help help poor peopl becom insur well my opinion is that is a veri good thing for the peopl in the communiti  peopl with no health care it good for them  it increas the peopl that can be cover by the health plan drive down health care cost for everyon the health of all american is veri import im on medicar and i see what it doe becaus it go to provid more health care for more peopl  make health coverag more becaus it allow equal opportun for everyon to have health insur i think we are closer and closer to give everyon health care coverag  this would help by not have pre  exist condit to whether or not someon has insur  senior citizen would final get the insur that we realli need  it realli necessari now   i am total with obama on the health care  everybodi need health insur  becaus it should help a lot of peopl out  we need a health care system that can help and not one that is not work or where were not satisfi with it  offer health for peopl that would not be abl to purchas it need one of the reason is becaus peopl need some help  a lot of peopl cant afford health care   becaus everyon need help obtain health insur final  the u s  has a good health care plan becaus we need it  peopl need health care  cheaper premium  it what best for the countri  i have not heard much about it it the onli way to ensur a healthi america   im a  i believ that there are children and famili that deserv health care becaus it is tri to do the best for the countri  more coverag option  it you can put anyth into law  peopl might do it just to do it   i think it will save us money on drug and care creat a more regul health care system    i think everyon need health care  it is veri import and i dont think that the less fortun should be deni health insur health care reform was in much need of this countri is in need of health care everyon deserv to have insur becaus everyon has health problem   health care is a major part american live to becom product  becaus i have peopl in my famili that have precondit that insur could turn them away becaus and i believ the health reform bill will prevent that i want peopl to have coverag and avail of health servic with no preexist condit exempt  i think there should be protect for peopl who can not get health insur through an employ  veri favor opinion for me becaus it was total for me to get a and the care that i receiv was realli well  health care has taken care of mani thing for me  im happi with it overal  it will put the u s  on the same as the rest of the world on health coverag it mean govern care about everybodi health give student the abil maintain insur on parent coverag the most of the bankruptci becaus of the peopl who dont pay their medic bill  the system is broken the expans to meet the need of peopl who current dont have insur becaus it help peopl who dont have money to pay for insur i think the drug and insur their price  lot of insur compani have a limit on how much money they will pay on what ill you have  a limit of how much money they will pay if they go past that  with this new reform they cant drop you the cost to implement the program i work in the health insur field and busi is pick up  becaus peopl dont want to be penal from the govern by  peopl would be fine 1  of their incom if they do not have health insur  in more of a chanc to get health insur i think it will decreas over time our insur rate  sinc everyon will have insur we need chang becaus i believ the govern has a right to protect all it peopl take health care out of the hand of govern  becaus there isnt one it help those who dont have enough coverag and those who dont have coverag at all  becaus it about time we got a start in make health care in the us a right rather than a privileg no penalti for prior health condit i believ  everyon should have health care  everybodi need to have some type of health coverag and if it govern mandat that the way it has to be it is need to improv health care for peopl who are uninsur or unabl to pay for health care medic coverag for everyon it expand medic and insur coverag to peopl who were not cover  here in everyon is insur and i think it should be that way the countri i havent seen anyth bad about  becaus not everyon has health insur  i think it good for the younger peopl to stay on parent insur till their it a step toward nation health care  becaus i think there is fair in it by fair i mean access all i hear is that peopl cant pay their prescript  becaus im in a posit to the medic profession and they need account to public for what they do more peopl that dont have insur will be abl to get it i have an adult daughter who can be cover with health insur until she is 26 daughter who went to school abl to stay on insur becaus there are so mani peopl like me who are in need of health care and cannot afford it feel that health reform is necessari  everyon should have insur and should be a requir becaus the system we have now terribl  i think everyon should be allow to have insur whether theyr work or not coverag for folk who dont have it  it make health care more access to more citizen becaus it will the peopl that has  been cover up until now im a doctor and it the onli way to fix thing  too mani peopl who dont have insur becaus there are way too mani peopl that are insur due to the insur compani and the new law put pressur to provid greater coverag becaus it was broke  you have peopl without the abil to have health care stick it to the insur industri  we are american and better than other countri  my famili should have to die to keep big rich becaus it will elimin to be turn down for previous condit somewhat with the insur compani  it insur the uninsur  becaus it will allow everi to have insur becaus i think everyon is entitl to health care i feel it an attempt help peopl that is uninsur if it for anybodi for help i am 100  for it overdu and need to pass provid more insur for more peopl it did not go far enough  there should be medicar for everi one  afford insur for a much base of peopl i believ we need to take care of our citizen i think health care for peopl that have low pay job is what we need  if you work you should have health care i think it will help provid health insur for more peopl tri someth differ and it might work  most preexist condit  it would put less money in the pocket of the privat health insur compani everyon should have health care  when you dont peopl wont pay their bill health is  1 if your not work have to deal with those peopl   it will the cost of health care for the better ive seen a lot of peopl who cant get the help that they need    under the new law they will get help someth i like it provid health care to those who dont have it and elimin pre exist condit  i think everyon should be allow to have medic insur  everybodi should be abl to have health care avail to them everyon should have access to heath care it will provid coverag for more lower incom famili becaus i obama and i trust him becaus the poor and needi need to be taken care of allow peopl to get insur at rate go to benefit everyon  like that peopl have to be insur regardless of pre exist condit favor becaus it would requir all american to have some type of insur it mean that individu such as myself will have to provid plan and there will be more afford plan becaus i think that it help the elder  someth need to be done  insur have been the system it help out the poor peopl  doesnt find it favor that it will be cover peopl who do not have insur or cant get insur i cant say anymor than it feel to me think it will help a lot of peopl becaus it will help peopl get health insur  everyon need health insur and it is so expens now  everyon deserv medic becaus it help the uninsur gain insur good for peopl who are not insur  kid can stay on parent plan longer becaus i think it will work in everybodi should have insur it is a start to provid health care to more american everybodi has a right to insur  i like the fact that it will insur a lot of current uninsur peopl anyon can get it  countri look after disabl and the poor take away some power from health insur compani it will provid health care coverag for peopl that has no insur or ani other health care coverag  becaus insur compani are tri to screw with everyon allow uninsur peopl to have the opportun to receiv insur  it cover peopl who cant afford health care and peopl with pre exist condit and is an afford  i think a step in the right direct to lower health cost  so everi one will have access to medic care  i just think there too mani peopl uninsur and it a strain on everyon els concern about peopl have health coverag and see this as a first good step it would exclud preexist condit   i was in the and i believ that everyon should have  health care and i am happi to pay into it as far as im concern it was about time in this countri   so mani without health care it a nation embarrass that everyon has coverag  i couldnt afford health care  now i have more option becaus they need some chang that need to be made like allow peopl with preexist condit to get insur becaus final someth is be done cant be deni for pre exist  children and adult children get to stay on insur it will benefit medicar patient who normal would not be abl to afford the medic they need i think more american should be cover by it  i dont know if they can control the cost with the insur compani  help peopl to get insur it target group that were not insur an system it is someth that absolut need to be done   and it is a start  health care cost will be reduc it deal with make sure that everyon has insur and keep children on the parent polici until age 26 and not take peopl off for pre exist condit i believ all peopl should have the avail of health insur  i think it a good idea becaus it provid medic care for those who cant afford it  in the long run you will have a healthier societi  i am year old and live on social secur  a lot of peopl dont have health insur  my has left come out of place and has no insur  more regul on the insur compani becaus i know peopl who need health care you can get health insur a littl bit cheaper one of the main reason a lot peopl need health care  will hold insur compani account not drop you for preexist condit need to do someth  peopl are unemploy  pre exist condit chang in this countri no one should be without medic attent most it is go to give coverag to peopl dont have it  everyon should have access to health care in this countri   the program should be more toward prevent and well it give everyon an opportun for the of happi and it mean know that i am okay they are concern about pre exist condit lot of american that are unemploy and need the health insur in my famili there are member without health insur and we have member pay a lot for the insur they have i am old enough where health care is an import issu for me  it is necessari to have comprehens health care in america to regardless of the individu abil to pay  i just think we need someth like that especi for the elder peopl  becaus it is there for all hope clear up the health care insur equal opportun for everybodi  becaus everybodi need heath care it help protect the elder cost wise  it help pay their bill for them peopl should not be deni from insur i believ we have to the privat sector and have as mani peopl insur as possibl all the citizen they should have  even if they cant afford  abl to go to medic  the remov of abil of insur compani to coverag for preexist condit  keep child on insur till 26  everybodi need health insur  everybodi should be entitl to health insur a lot of peopl need it and peopl need health insur becaus i am a middl class poor and it help me  i just have medicar i think it even thing and help everyon well  a whole lot of peopl will get medic attent who did not get it befor  if we dont have health care reform  then there will be mass bodi in of the hospit  doctor offic  and drug  somebodi is go to have to take care of these peopl without insur  it allow children to be older and still be on parent plan  health care for all is import   everybodi should kick in extend age for depend coverag to all the countri   right now i have no coverag and cannot probabl go to a hospit pre we have lot of peopl that need help with coverag i feel there should be free health care  becaus i am old and need all the help i can get i feel that it is favor becaus it did not go far enough it cover all peopl and it cut the cost of health care think that the countri need it i thought it would help peopl of middl incom tri to get a hold of the health care cost i dont think it go to do ani harm  it in right direct toward reform  in to other countri and our health care  we have doctor the benefit but not everyon has money to get health care  it is protect peopl who need insur it good for more peopl than it not and it good for low incom and small busi becaus i think the repres are do everyth to line their pocket i think someth need to chang  could not  becaus it start the process of get health care so far it has work out for the work class it will cover the peopl dont have health care and it will cover older children univers health care for children  unit state need a system it will help peopl that are current uninsur someth had to be done   the compani can no longer exclud you from insur my son is in colleg and he can stay on my insur until he  which may not be for some time  and he can onli find part time work which doe not offer health insur  everyon should have medic insur it all need fix  and make step to have health care the better i dont believ that peopl should expect me to pay for their health care   i want them cover  it help more peopl get insur not sure of what it  seem to be work for senior im on medicar for peopl who take drug and thing it will help them it seem good   health care should be someth peopl have  cover more peopl  i like some of it but dont like other part it take the power away from the insur compani  becaus everybodi  even though everybodi go to have insur and share the burden  it not the same as a one share system  everyon should have health care becaus it help more peopl who dont have and cant afford insur i like the fact that they cant turn peopl away with pre  exist condit  i like that they cover young peopl to the age 26 under their parent health plan  becaus i work in health care and it broken and i believ in univers health care for everybodi offer extend benefit to kid out of colleg who are not yet employ everybodi should be cover  becaus it a step in the right direct medic cost are get too high  i think it get more of the peopl cover by health insur and it help control the rise in the cost of medic care i like that i receiv a rate for my health care when my husband pass away  this was no of my own  it cover more peopl who live in the u s  everyon is cover some is good some is bad   price will go up it help peopl who cannot take care of their own health  i have been in a small busi on my own and found that the health care market has not allow much choic for those who buy insur and those who buy insur pay for the uninsur porqu mucha no  no becaus there are mani person not suffici money  i cannot be understood  move to public is good for the govern to provid this servic we need reform  it  i think that it go in the right direct with problem that need to be address  the health reform law now extend coverag to american who do not have coverag and as the bill will stop over time becaus i believ everyon should be entitl to health care there are just some thing in the bill that need to be done our program is broken it go to help everyon it use research product and privat health care to expand plan so all american can get proper health care becaus it make it so poor peopl can get a chanc to get health care also  it give everybodi an opportun to have health insur and the fact that insur compani cant drop peopl from pre exist condit reform was much need and i believ it will extend health care to a greater number of the american public save all taxpay money in the long run as i understand pre exist condit is allow and i realli like that kid over 18 can be includ with parent   lot of peopl in the countri help  less fortun peopl need help in the  no pre exist condit i believ it would help creat a favor system and help those that need insur get insur  is need reform  we need it  a lot of peopl do   i dont realli know that much about it  it great health care should be provid i think they have to start somewher  there are a lot of peopl who dont have insur and need it there are too mani peopl around without afford health insur the sky health care cost  i think that all of us need to be on a better plan than we were  so mani peopl do not have insur so mani peopl need medicar i have two daughter in colleg and the new health reform law has enabl them to be on my health insur plan becaus it provid afford insur to peopl otherwis not abl to have it   remov prior to pre exist condit  i like that it requir everyon to purchas health care  becaus it go to take care of mani other peopl who cant afford insur becaus the peopl get insur who dont have it and children can stay on their parent insur until age 26 it allow kid to stay on their parent health plan until theyr 26 year old i feel like the health industri and insur compani are get out of hand with the health fee becaus im a democrat  give that do have insur will have insur it will help make our countri healthier it help reduc the cost of health care for everyon it is design to help senior citizen by help with the prescript drug too mani peopl dont have health insur i would like to see more option avail hes tri to help communiti not the or black becaus a lot of peopl will be abl to have health insur  2  that we will not be deni for pre condit  3  have my son on my polici until he is 26  i think it make it possibl for peopl to get insur  i just think peopl should have insur to be abl to go the doctor  provid coverag to more peopl becaus it would provid access to health care to a larg number of peopl everyon need health care and the govern should make it afford to all american daughter would keep her on insur until 26  preexist cost  husband diabet  i pay too much for health insur and the servic is limit  i have sever and my insur exclud my treatment as too expens obama is start to better the health care becaus im go to be abl to afford health insur    go to give the opportun to the uninsur to get insur that will actual cover someth and be it it address some major concern in the countri  peopl cannot get insur right now that have pre condit 2  it the donut hole a littl bit  part  becaus now a lot more peopl can be cover by health insur  becaus there are mani peopl in the unit state that do not have health care coverag and i believ it is the govern respons to provid it at an afford price  becaus i think health insur should be more afford in america i think everi one should have health insur especi the disabl and the one that have a ill that need insur to live the new law help the low incom american the health reform law will help a lot of peopl who are not cover get the help they need  and hope lower price for medicin and some co pay  we will all be cover by insur i think that it is good that the health care is avail for peopl who cannot afford it my famili has been abl to get coverag after be so long without it more peopl are abl to get insur  they got better insur and afford it allow peopl who have had pre exist condit an opportun to receiv health care now  i think more peopl will benefit from the health care reform   it go to be easier to get insur  it seem like theyr tri to do better i think it would help out peopl who are in need of health insur i think peopl need it  more peopl will have access to health care i think it protect peopl privaci better becaus i feel that if peopl cannot afford health care the govern has an oblig to provid that for them health care is major issu in america today mani peopl are without health insur i think this is a step in the right direct  i need to read up on it a littl more but i know it will help with my parent as far as the prescript drug cost the health reform will help lower incom american more obama is fix the health reform  i think it would be better for peopl that are not insur but i think the premium will go up for the insur so it is a mix feel on the health reform law me and my famili are abl to pay afford insur and were abl to get the right medic for my mother not the it about time america step up to the i just think it cover peopl who other wise do not have coverag  well i guess becaus it been need for along time i think it import for peopl no matter their condit to have health care  some peopl cant afford what the system has to offer i think it will benefit them as well becaus it give the insur compani less control becaus i think everyon should have health insur becaus i think it import for everyon to have i think that more option should be avail and the govern has too much power i think it is a that so mani dont have health coverag  we need it too mani peopl with no insur they pay most of the cost for me becaus i can afford health care now becaus everyon should have health insur that is not too expens it expand the on avail it go to help me afford my medic and doctor visit i hope  i feel like everybodi should have benefit i agre with some of it and dont agre with some of it   i do agre with the price  what it cost to get prescript and thing like that  there are no thing that i dont agre with that they cant deni peopl with pre exist condit everybodi deserv to have health insur and to be taken care of with out have to struggl to get the medic attent they need or the correct prescript or medic i am favor of it becaus the age has chang and also i think it is benefici to everyon with health care   it just help peopl out im of peopl health in  becaus the health industri need reform a lot of peopl have lost their job  she doesnt understand it  it give insur to everybodi in time i think there need to be chang  as i said i think everyon should have health coverag becaus american need to be abl to get a hold of health insur at an afford price  everybodi is requir to have insur and no for pre exist condit someth has to be done becaus a lot of american are suffer or have a hard time due to the law that is in now  becaus i am disabl and everyon need health care and i have benefit it from it more of choic in the health care go to the emerg room and you work for minimum wage they dont treat you right made me wait for hour and we didnt have real health care coverag   it just has not been fair and peopl should have to suffer in the richest nation in the world becaus it seem to me that go to the doctor is way too about insur and i think this law will help out  think that it will do good there part that have benefit and other dont  i believ it is a good attempt at give everyon health coverag anyth better than now it open the door for drug compani to give on drug  it help peopl who dont have insur to have insur everyon will get afford health care becaus they wont deni anybodi becaus of a medic becaus everybodi deserv to have good health care and good treatment  they deserv to get the right medicin and not the kind and becaus nobodi deserv to struggl to keep them self healthi   it is better for societi it help everybodi help a lot get health insur becaus we are final be abl to help the elder and young kid that havent had health care in a while i think everyon should have health insur  the govern is start to help the uninsur    the govern is now help the uninsur i appreci the fact to give individu who dont have insur coverag it cover exist ill  good step to stop the corrupt i think everyon should be abl to get the health care they need  it is for peopl who are have difficulti get health insur not enough health care for peopl who need it the need to someth with the cost becaus they chang what they initi want to do it go to help in the long run for peopl who can not get insur i am for the plan becaus it was never on in becaus it give health benefit to more peopl in america  less peopl will go bankrupt i believ it need to be pass so someth can be done about the health insur  i will give peopl who other wise would not get health insur a chanc to be offer afford insur  peopl should have health care  more peopl should be abl to benefit from health care now i believ everyon should have the right health care it help me get prescript that i could not get befor a lot of peopl do not have health care becaus i have of cancer and couldnt get insur it allow those with pre exist health condit to be abl to get insur   more of medic help be offer we need afford health insur in america  as a patient i have chronic reason and it go to benefit from it as well as my daughter and son and husband it will give everybodi health care it seem there are a lot of peopl that do not have health care in fact more poor peopl that do not have health care and im hope that with the reform it will help the less fortun and provid them with health care at a more afford price  i think it help peopl like me who need the coverag it will be better for american so they can be abl to afford health care it did not go far enough he has diabet my son that is in colleg can now have health insur the govern will be provid more help to the hispan communiti  it have health care coverag for everybodi it benefici to peopl come from a famili of worker that were effect by the recess   appreci that it provid for the underprivileg    becaus i know what they were tri to do with it was tri to make sure everyon can get health insur becaus to budget offic it would save money i think someth that been done good for the health care uninsur will have insur  im a 100 disabl and the veteran assist pay for my health care i believ it someth that need by a lot of peopl who dont have insur  think it should be a singl payer system  govern should be the one provid it to everybodi  not privat insur compani i just think it time that we did someth about insur  i like what the presid do   it provid health care for all american help everyon it will benefit the peopl who cant afford health coverag for small kid and elder  it better than noth it give peopl an opportun to afford insur when they otherwis wouldnt be abl to the medic system becaus it the plan that provid univers health care im somewhat favor becaus i agre with some of the provis of the law not all of it  i agre with the close of the donut hole and not be abl to deni coverag to individu with pre exist condit i dont agre with all american have it a step in the right direct the health care system need to be fix  peopl with pre exist condit can now get insur   the cost will go down if everyon get on board  becaus i understand the medic need for everybodi i eventu think it will lower the health care premium in america i feel like everyon should be insur and not be penal and im in favor of it    i am self employ and insur is too expens and ive been deni becaus peopl should be abl to have health insur and also should be abl to get it i do believ everybodi should have health insur and be abl to go to the doctor and not worri about not be abl to be treat or not it an improv of what we had and it will help other peopl get health  insur and it will decreas the deficit over the next year it was a long time come  need to be done should benefit a whole lot of peopl becaus everybodi need health insur  becaus i want all peopl who dont have insur to have insur to have insur i will be will to for everyon to have insur it extend coverag to the uninsur which is necessari for a civil countri  the new reform will allow other with pre exist condit to get insur  i think it will help peopl who do not have health insur to get health care and be abl to pay for it  the current health system in the countri is in sever need of overhaul  i believ the health bill was a signific improv i like that my children will be abl to afford their own health coverag after age 25 i think everybodi need health care it cost more when peopl do not have health care it should lower the cost of go to the hospit for everybodi becaus i think we need to move toward univers health care so everyon can have health insur  i am a senior citizen and i need help with premium  medic  and hospit as person who doe not make that much money it would help me and my famili out  when peopl get old they do not have much money to spend  it is just a start  im glad that someon has got a hold to the budget a lot dont have the opportun to get help from the govern and this will benefit everyon to get help i think it should be avail to everyon  everybodi should have a good at health insur and it not avail to everyon  becaus all american should be abl to afford health insur everyon use have health insur  well the main reason is becaus we couldnt get health insur for my mother but we were abl to get a decent plan for her   you got to have insur and you need some way to control it  the govern is make the health care more expand for the uninsur sinc peopl are get it a good thing to be abl to get help especi those who arent abl to  everyon will eventu have insur  becaus their are so mani peopl out there that need health insur and the new health reform law will provid that becaus my elder parent have been struggl to get medic coverag an now under the new law it made it easier for them insur for everybodi becaus the countri and the world we need to provid for our own peopl  so mani peopl do not have insur  from my understand it to make afford health care access and at this time it is someth that is definit need  becaus i believ the health reform is final take the right turn to help out all uninsur it help the peopl out   well it hard to pay for a doctor when you have a limit in come  i been unemploy and it go to help me get health insur i feel everybodi should be cover by health insur and it look like it happen now well suppos the cost of insur is go to be more afford make it easier to buy insur  when i get health insur itll be nice to have our countri need to chang the old system it terribl the health reform law would be a good thing for the peopl that is uninsur we need the health care system and govern overhaul they are both full of crook i think the health reform law will help citizen who do not have insur more  peopl who dont have insur will get a chanc to get it our countri as a whole need a chang especi the health care  it is an attempt to give all american access to health care  i am in support of it  the lower class worker will health care  i think it is good that they are tri to get everyon access to health care  i like the fact that you do not have to  children can stay till 26 becaus we need a big chang that will help peopl ive been a sick man for year and this help me with me medic and becaus of them ive been good these year it will allow all peopl to get coverag regardless of what they can afford becaus should have insur becaus it let you insur your kid until theyr 26 becaus im a nurs and ive work in a general hospit and everybodi get health care anyway so everybodi should contribut  a lot of peopl dont health insur  provid health care for all american continu of health coverag for depend until theyr 26  i think that everyon should be insur in the countri  have better access than befor and i like they got rid of preexist condit  i think everyon need health insur i just hope it will help peopl who need it children are abl to stay on parent health until age 26  the pre exist will be out unit state is the onli industri countri that doe not have full heath care for everyon we need to work on health care if we dont pass someth there will be too mani peopl who wont have health care save money for peopl  too mani peopl who dont have insur use emerg room the cost of health care is out of control should be afford to everybodi i think that in general it go to help a lot more peopl becaus i went year without health insur i have been in one time been with one provid  and now i am on medicar and medicaid expand health care coverag for peopl who cant afford it becaus they say it help everyon to have health care im in favor of univers health dont want peopl be deni insur becaus pre condit i dont run to the doctor all the time and sometim the doctor doe not give the medic that you may need caus when i get older i want the same just too mani peopl not get health care becaus more peopl will receiv coverag under this health reform just think it a veri good idea it make it more fair necessari for peopl who have diseas prevent insur compani from coverag insur for base of peopl her mom get cover for the pre exist condit still get you coverag i like the fact they are allow student to stay on their parent up to 26 year of age  i like the fact that more american will have health coverag so they can be care for  favor about the fact that peopl with pre exist condit can now get health insur  mani peopl in tax do not have health care everyon is cover and peopl will use regular doctor instead of the emerg room for littl problem it cover area that need to be address everi american should be insur the insur compani have been abl to ani insur medic reform it bring the qualiti for peopl that need health care in this countri for peopl that couldnt afford it the children are under the parent coverag until it go to make me have to buy health insur i have famili that will benefit from it becaus i think that everybodi deserv health care and it a start  i think that it need more provis but it is good for the peopl becaus everybodi will have health care there are a lot of peopl that need help they increas coverag for u s  citizen expand health care coverag medicar everybodi has the right to have coverag  some third world countri have insur start in the right direct univers coverag  i have some pretti sever medic issu and havent been abl to afford healthcar and without health care reform i will probabl die i believ it will lower everyon medic cost just know medicar is a part im with  we carri our own health insur but use medicar medicaid and medicar the unfair way hospit have with peopl who dont have health care it make sure the children has coverag  im that my son is abl to stay on our health insur until he is 26   effect  it allow peopl to get insur if they dont have one  i think that everi u s  citizen is entitl to health care  becaus i believ everi should have health care the overal cost of the individu caus it doe what it suppos to theyll be more children taken care of  instead of be sick and not have ani health plan i just think we have to do someth in this countri for peopl to be cover the main reason is that it doe provid health care for peopl who do not have it  those who do not have the mean to get health care can now get it  equal of the medic care he doesnt see whi they have to forc it   we need to do someth differ then what we were do it give peopl an opportun to get coverag who otherwis would not have becaus it cover uninsur peopl i think cover the health care need of everyon in this countri is import it will provid health care to everybodi it go to give health insur to peopl who have not in past i am in favor of have everyon have medic coverag i was abl to cover my son while he was in school becaus it is a step toward have better health care becaus it give more peopl coverag  it my understand that more peopl will have access to health care becaus it has enabl me to obtain health insur for myself becaus i social secur and use medicar is good lower health cost for general popul becaus it allow more peopl to have health coverag becaus there so mani peopl out there that need health care and dont have it too mani peopl that were not get health insur that are now elig i thought it would give everyon health care  will suppli more health care for peopl  retir health care worker and know what it like to be up in the emerg room without insur  we need to start take care of peopl  we should at least take care of peopl who have major  problem  i think we need to cover peopl who cant get cover and save more money it get everybodi cover who couldnt otherwis get coverag there too mani peopl that dont have insur that need help have a son with a pre exist medic condit and alreadi enrol him in the program  i think everyon need insur becaus it will allow the less fortun peopl who dont have health insur to receiv it  becaus we all should have insur right now and my husband are unemploy and without this health we wouldnt afford health coverag all american deserv access to health care the medicin is cheaper  becaus it provid more health care for peopl  will give more coverag for more peopl  account to cover peopl who were not abl to be cover befor at the rate it go  if the govern doesnt step in  well all die off becaus wont be abl to afford thing  we wont be abl to afford the test to learn our status  then by the time our famili find out if were not we wont be it is there when i need all poor peopl need health care  for reason but main becaus it get rid of the preexist condit  becaus everyon is entitl to health insur becaus it make health care afford to those who havent been abl to afford it  seem better than what we have now i like that they elimin lifetim cap i think so mani peopl need it  give more peopl access to health care in the long run forc doctor to be account to patient health will lower overal health care cost in this countri over the long run senior need help with medic care  well  i believ that it go to cover the need that im go to experi im year old hope it go to help peopl who need it and not cut off other peopl it afford more peopl more care for less money i like health care to be more avail to more peopl  i think that health care is not a privileg   it a right i think everyon should have health care becaus it seem to be more inclus than previous than insur well becaus i think everyon should be abl to have insur and health care but this did not reach far  we should have someth like canada has   unit state deserv to have insur too mani peopl that dont have health care  it go to reform the price the insur provid i think we should have some sort of nation health care system so health care is avail to everyon cant hate someth you dont know becaus everi one should have health coverag has not bother me at all  i have insur and i just go on with that a great idea becaus i think health care should be a right everyon has  everi in the unit state should have health reform  it provid health care for peopl who would not have it other wise  it may help peopl who are senior citizen health care is import and expens  and it is import that everyon has it  becaus it provid me with what i need the possibl the more peopl will have insur  becaus of it on prevent  everyon should have health benefit live on fix incom you need that help  well i hope it go to make thing better than what they are now becaus im a old person and i cant wait to get better medicar i like the concept  it would be nice if everyon had health insur  i think it go to cut back on social secur  to help other out becaus it an attempt to get health reform in this countri  becaus of health care cost has gotten out of control it the govern respons to take care of it peopl the requir of everyon to have health care all american should have health care so everybodi can get insur   price onli know what it said on tv  benefit for certain peopl like me everyon need health care im just a  provid addit coverag for middl class american   hope it will give peopl the opportun to see a  that cant afford it more peopl have access to health care  good for everybodi ad uninsur to the roll  becaus it allow me to keep my kid until they are 25 and it doe not allow medic insur compani to deni health care of pre exist condit becaus other nation has this and it is about time we provid it too becaus more peopl get health coverag as a person who has spent 25 year a social worker it is a base  we have been pay for insur for over 40 year  it is so expens to go to the emerg room so it make my insur higher becaus other peopl cannot afford it  becaus some thing chang didnt like porqu no los dan a major  becaus not all the medicin they give them to the biggest person the thing i read about  they will have everyon insur so everyon will be cover it would make it better for senior for the cost of medicin  make it better for everyon to get health care  it cover health care with pre exist condit  allow children still in school to have health care until an older age it might end up with everyon have health coverag i dont have dental insur and i know how it feel to not have insur and basic i feel for the other peopl who dont have insur it provid health insur for more peopl will allow afford health care to everyon allow more peopl to have health coverag i think it is good if everybodi has health insur anyth is better than what we had befor it a start to univers health care  they can treat us better everybodi has health care make sure everi one pay for it instead of the govern pay a lot of poor peopl that need help  i think peopl deserv insur coverag  i dont think anybodi should be left out  peopl ask becaus they have no choic allow greater option for health care i believ that with prevent care health care could be reduc we need to have afford coverag for the million of peopl who dont have it   it provid access to peopl that dont have it  it give access to health care for more individu not go to get the care she got befor  i think it fair i believ everyon should have health care and no should lose their home or job becaus of health care make them financi respons think that the health care need to be access to everyon the veri peopl it was design for theyr get free health care that peopl have better health insur than they did befor  it help a littl but not a lot just think we need to make chang primarili becaus it the right for everi american to have a healthi life   regardless of what happen in the american financi status there should be a huge for the govern to play in the health of their citizen  it will benefit peopl who are not abl to get medic benefit befor i just turn and more import i have work in medic for the past year and so im a certain in medic believ everyon need health insur daughter is abl to stay cover basic tri to provid health care for all peopl becaus it will make insur avail to most american i believ the peopl should get health care if they need it provid insur assist for peopl who cant afford it insur cannot deni you from coverag in general that health reform was need i dont believ all of it is the great thing for us but i do believ it a great begin it make avail to peopl who do not have health insur  coverag would be extend to peopl with pre exist condit i like the individu mandat  i like that it the state exchang other develop countri do have develop health care and it work good for them becaus when one goe to the hospit you got to pay a lot of money if you dont have insur  and this help a lot becaus that way everyon had medic care becaus the peopl that need it get it  becaus i have famili member who will be posit affect by it becaus i feel that everyon should be abl to have health insur  you can have it  and everybodi els can  and no preexist condit i think it will help with keep the cost of health care lower becaus of our presid i think everybodi is entitl to good health care regardless of their abil to pay becaus i feel peopl who dont have insur or who do save insur more money by go to the emerg room and have there are a lot of peopl out there that cant afford health care  pre exist condit state health insur has not been impact  becaus i believ our govern has made our health care unafford and it their job to make it afford may reduc health care cost it give peopl who cannot afford health insur  insur mani peopl in the us need medic becaus im and i need all the help i can get  the mandat of it  insur compani prior to had the abil to refus to it    i believ in fair coverag  becaus it for the kid and it import from what i understand it go to requir servic  less agenc will have to work more close togeth someth is better than noth i know peopl that would benefit from someth like that the health reform will benefit peopl who dont health at this time  but some peopl will be hurt by it  im veri with the medic field and the care of patient and there are a lot of aspect they cant afford our societi look for two side  one for one  one for all and one main for itself  i think the economi is on the one for all side itself  becaus it allow peopl with pre exist condit receiv health insur  help a lot of peopl i think it right that everyon should have insur or should be treat becaus it absolut necessari that we reform health polici in the us and this law is the onli thing we could get at this time it not perfect it a good law for the hospit becaus i think it more equit and servic more peopl in need where i work now dont offer insur but in they will offer me insur and they dont know what the premium will be it provid health care for a greater number of peopl i think it need to be fix  becaus i need insur it go to assist a lot of peopl who would not otherwis have health care too mani peopl dont have medic care and with the law more peopl will have access to servic pressur becaus it increas general elig  it is fair to everyon it requir insur and everybodi should be insur it insur more peopl and keep cost down becaus it allow everyon to get better access to health care i like the way they are handl the health care  but not the doctor are do it is becaus so mani student are not cover in their parent health insur  cover more peopl and the govern should cover more peopl  it will provid insur for lot of peopl who cant afford it work part time it will provid access to more health care for more peopl children can stay on their parent insur longer becaus it give peopl more control of the benefit of their children it pay more for primari care physician and preexist condit becaus insur cant peopl with preexist condit and peopl live their parent home can still be insur becaus i havent had health insur sinc i was and my employ wont provid insur one of the richest countri is final step up provid insur to the under privileg it move us closer to a univers singl payer system becaus it increas access to health care but it still expens one of the reason is becaus i think that it should be that everyon has health care i was rais in peopl didnt have worri about pay to go to the doctor  it alreadi help me out with my insur and with better coverag  becaus it is not hurt me as an individu  everybodi will have better insur becaus it cover a lot of peopl who might not have been abl to have access to medic servic  becaus i think that everybodi deserv to have the same health care just someth that will help get everyon health insur  peopl who dont have it and peopl who cannot afford it  becaus everyon has the right to health care  i can put myself posit where i know what peopl who need health care feel like it help the situat where more peopl are get the help they need  where they werent abl to befor   provid access to health insur to peopl who did not have it in the past  maintain children on the insur who kid in colleg  it allow student to stay on their parent medic insur until the age 26 and other doctor can take patient with preexist condit i have a daughter that in colleg and and she can stay on my insur until she is 26  the law system it   i mean everybodi take the law into their own hand and there are peopl who get out of control  becaus i think everybodi should have health care  i live on disabl  and my mother is elder a good start health care is a basic human right i think that the fact that peopl with pre exist can get insur im tire of the doctor get paid lot of money and from pharmaceut compani help us get closer to univers coverag i think that becaus of them some of us can benefit from it everyon need health care need by mani it is go to be easier to get more health care becaus i think it good that everybodi should have health insur  i have a son with and i can keep him on my insur longer and he cannot be deni for his pre  exist condit   i think everyon should have health insur i like that it help the peopl who cant afford health care  becaus i believ if the govern is do more to help out the lower class peopl than it had been do befor  univers avail everybodi will have to be cover by health insur it realli need the system will eventu decreas cost can have a pre exist condit and still get health insur  it will reach more peopl and extend more coverag and it is a thing than what we had the insur compani are crook and the obama care is an improv over old system  basic for peopl who have pre exist condit can now get health coverag  and then also becaus more now have health insur that could never have it befor  becaus everybodi doesnt have health insur too mani peopl dont have access to health care right now  and this will provid more access i dont know that much about it i dont hate it   the inclus of everyon receiv health care  it help peopl with preexist condit  increas number of peopl with coverag i think everyon should have health insur becaus it suppos to give more peopl access to health insur there million of peopl without health care in the world richest nation there no reason peopl should be without it becaus everybodi need it  the pre exist condit do away with that  no lifetim limit cap and children be abl to stay on parent insur until age 26  i believ that we should all have health care  it is veri difficult to come by  if you come over to the countri and you are not to anyon it can be veri difficult to get some it just better for us peopl pre exist condit are go to be abl to cover now equal foot of and equal servic and less power of insur and better power just like the idea that is becaus rise health care cost are a big concern to me and have cost the compani i work for a lot of money  and it help get to the of the problem  it need to be better i do not realli understand it  it sound like a good idea  but i think the govern should pick up more on the health care  particular in regard to senior  i understand that it might hurt small busi and the govern need to into it a step in the right direct becaus it requir everyon to get coverag becaus when the exchang is final they are go to be offer cheaper insur after the law in mass the privat insur busi we are current is realli bad and the health care reform extend it to peopl i it as someth that all american get the health care that we need  health care is so expens  insur compani make so much money and peopl cant afford it becaus of a lot of peopl cant get medic treatment becaus they dont have insur i dont know too much about but im just go with the general public opinion more access everyon deserv health care it make avail of health insur that dont have it the hous repres they pass a law to do some and the wont do anyth about it the fact that peopl who are uninsur can get help and peopl with pre exist condit can not be deni health care i am a person without a lot of incom they treat and the govern should pay you should be abl to coverag and insur for the one your take care of  it the thing that has pass congress that is compar to the singl  system given current polit  i am a doctor and all my patient are poor and they will benefit with increas coverag  they will now receiv coverag  it go to give everyon health care becaus i think it benefit the senior citizen provid health care to peopl current who do not have it i think everybodi should have health care insur main becaus it reform and call attent to the problem that exist  everyon is go to have a health insur that they didnt have befor  i can be attend and befor i couldnt i think that the health reform will fill in the gap and work forc for women as far as leav for the most part it help the general public  becaus a lot of peopl cannot pay their medic expens  and the law has help improv that we need someth like that in this  becaus it give peopl more benefit general make health insur avail for everyon is the right thing to do  im will to pay a littl more to make sure everyon doe get it everybodi in the usa should have the access to afford health care make sure everyon get it the health care system is be take care of  just the fact that it help a lot more than anyth we have had befor  we need the health insur i believ the govern should take part in the welfar of take care of it peopl everyon should be abl to access health care it benefici for more peopl to have access to health insur  peopl will have health insur who dont have it now   becaus i think theyr tri to do someth and someth need to be done there are a lot of provis you dont have worri about like the  pre exist condit you do not worri about i think it will help the american peopl  overal it is a great piec of legisl  help those that cant pay  i have a who has cancer and without the health care law he would not be abl to afford health insur everyon should have basic access to health care i think it definit reform i know theyr say it cut medicar  it chang  peopl to have health insur i just think it nice that we all are go to have a set insur plan becaus we should be look out for all of our peopl in america  im for it becaus it help a lot of the needi  get rid of pre exist condit is huge everi singl person should have health insur i think it cost effect i think that everybodi should be allow to have health insur and i believ that busi owner should help provid that  my and i we have three kid and allow the three kid to be under his insur for a longer period of time is extrem  especi sinc the kid are all full time student  i think it better for the peopl and the countri i think that everyon should have the same privileg have to health insur  it a way for the poor to have health insur i like the univers health care  i like the insur exchang to creat competit and drive down cost there a lot of peopl who dont have access to health care financi previous insur compani could stop cover you becaus it go to better i believ that it will help peopl who current dont have access to health care becaus it is benefit all of us it more fair and it someth i think we need to do in this countri for a long time the peopl that need health insur and the is afford lower cost  increas servic becaus i understand it 100  and it make everybodi equal becaus long term is go to reduc the deficit cant afford insur everyon need insur help a lot of peopl go to solv a problem that we had a long time becaus the american peopl should have free health care like they do in other countri itll help peopl who need it becaus i work in health care and see peopl deni for no insur i feel it a start toward have everybodi in our countri cover becaus my children can stay on my polici until 26 it cover a lot of peopl becaus the system is as it and stand is veri veri broken it for everyon to have health care coverag i like the coverag that it provid for women and i appreci that there is some effort to reduc health care cost in this countri  that will help  becaus i think it help peopl without insur get medic care  it provid better control over the pharmaceut  peopl need to be taken care of and we need to in the cost of hospit and this will allow peopl to get the care that they need  becaus everyon should have health care becaus we live in mass  and we have a health reform law that is realli work here and hope it will do the same for the rest of the countri  to me it seem theyr get more in the way of hospit and insur from over charg  too mani peopl without insur good insur allow everyon to have insur it basic go to help everybodi i got some insur out of the deal everybodi will have afford health care   im an immigr and i live in countri where health care is provid free of charg to peopl and im support becaus i think it a step toward afford  health care for peopl to some hold the insur industri account  equal health care for all peopl who could not afford health care is get a chanc becaus i think all peopl should have the abil to get health insur  i feel they can do thing differ about medicin becaus health need to be reform and someth need to be done about it becaus you cannot be turn down for preexist medic  becaus there are so mani uninsur peopl it probabl a good thing  it will elimin a lot of the health problem in this countri i think  it doe in some matter tri to the gap of those who doesnt have insur at all i like the idea that children can stay on their parent health care  there no longer preexist condit becaus everybodi can now have health care  becaus everybodi doe need insur  it doesnt allow insur compani to deni you for pre exist condit  make an effort to do that becaus it make health insur afford for peopl without insur becaus i think it been bad need  we have mani peopl who dont have access to health insur  realli for prevent medicin i think it start out not so well when it was first start  but i have friend that have sign up for it and they have gotten some pretti good deal at the health care gov  more peopl have health insur it is so much confus im veri in work a food project  i make look for work  in worri about the health care  and it help them with the new inform i like to see peopl who dont have  have it  provid coverag to peopl who need it at reason price  everyon need insur i think becaus it allow peopl without insur the abil to get insur it give those peopl who didnt qualifi for insur to get insur now  there is univers heath care for everybodi i think everybodi deserv to have health insur regardless of their job or incom peopl can get their check up and go to the doctor no reason  more peopl can get insur i like it becaus it can help us in ani situat we can pay our account the hous of repres and congress to do it work in canada  becaus they use to not take you if you are ill i think it is a good choic  the lower class can afford it help get peopl get insur that dont have insur im on medicar i dont use it some thing have to chang if they continu the way they were becaus we are an industri nation and it was to let the poor go without insur  becaus it fill the gap for everyon to be cover  everyon can get health care get and see a doctor and go the hospit taken care of their need those who dont have health insur it help fix the system that was broken  i was one that was discrimin against becaus of pre exist condit when you hear of peopl lose their life for catastroph reason this break my and so this whi i think everyon should have health insur  it requir everyon to be given health care at a given price  to still give health care becaus i think health care in this countri was in a mess befor i think ani attempt to improv it would be help to where it was previous  i think it should be the way that it was  everyon should have the right for insur becaus so mani peopl couldnt afford it  i agre what obama is do  everyth has gone well for us  were retir peopl that have health insur and it has been fine  becaus all peopl should have insur becaus a lot of peopl who otherwis would not have insur will now have it  everybodi need insur think we all need health care it will make sure peopl that dont have health are cover everyon should have access to health care  cant be deni for an exist condit  it a step in the right direct for univers health care  i think it unfair for peopl who cant afford insur becaus ive seen peopl who have been unabl to get heath insur and as a nation we should provid heath insur to go to the doctor it shouldnt be out of reach to go to the doctor i come from a long famili that never had health treatment and i think everyon should have health insur  i had to go in the militari to get health insur and i think everyon should pay for it  not just the rich  becaus it take care of me  i dont pay veri much for doctor visit the govern should give health insur so peopl can save someth from their pocket becaus eventu it will cover all the peopl in the unit state a friend of mind had to get and time out and he was abl to get it with the heath reform bill  becaus it help my get heath insur it a start for what we need to do well caus it will help the low incom peopl provid insur for peopl who didnt have it i believ that everyon should have access to health care when they need physician servic health benefit for peopl without insur becaus i think it necessari a necessari program that need to be implement  they cant push you off becaus of pre exist  and keep your children until age 26 it will help lower the cost  it open access to more peopl becaus the whole countri need it i think the unit state need to up with the rest of the world way too mani peopl dont have insur and use the e  and that will be reduc the addit number of peopl who now have health care coverag  becaus there were too mani peopl who couldnt get coverag and they took away the preexist condit rule and that i think the u s  deserv health care allow health coverag for peopl with preexist condit it should help a lot of peopl im look for more afford health insur coverag for me and my famili becaus health should be free for everyon and should not be depend on unemploy becaus everyon has a right to have health insur  it is in our best interest becaus a lot of peopl are struggl and need assist with medic care that whi i am general favor of it  becaus someth need to be done  i like how peopl can be cover up to 26 old  and the no pre exist condit becaus it is import  for everyon to have health insur it make it possibl for everyon to have health insur  becaus there is peopl that have problem with their health and this bill will certain help basic they offer health insur to peopl who could not afford it  becaus a lot of peopl need it that cant afford it it fair for everyon we need to chang the way the payment system work and we need to have everyon particip i e   univers care it take the power away from the health care compani  it allow everyon to have health care  i just turn 65 and i got my medicar  i believ it help a lot of peopl that arent  abl to buy health care in the past and are now abl to the onli thing on the  health care need to be  it a start afford health care for everyon and when peopl the go to emerg room tax payer dont have to foot the bill becaus you need to have everyon avail to be well  you dont have money it hard to do that so a lot more peopl becaus they are poor dont get health care this way get health care  i just think part of it need to be and it did not roll out effect and somewhat becaus there are peopl who are not abl to keep their own doctor so promis werent kept 40 million peopl didnt have health care  it help peopl  it bring my premium down and it help peopl get insur  becaus obama is great it give everybodi insur and everybodi need insur just becaus i like someth need to be chang becaus peopl need health care  there are a lot of peopl who are uninsur give more peopl to be insur becaus health insur is too difficult and expens for peopl with preexist condit it make it better for peopl who work part time with the amount of illeg immigr it forc peopl to get health insur it provid insur for those who dont have it  move u s  forward to health care it pay for my birth control i have a preexist condit  i had problem get insur befor  i have insur now but if that chang ill be abl to get some  so it veri person give peopl health care for peopl who cant afford it a nation health care plan is need  it is an import step  i am not sure of the right but i think it is a great idea and i would like to see it  becaus peopl can get health care without it be tie to their job  peopl with preexist health condit can get it now and peopl who dont have much money can get it now it help a lot of young kid obtain health care and it afford for peopl to have health care  i work in the medic field and i see a lot of medic patient bill are high becaus they dont have insur and if they had insur they would be more to get the correct medic help they need i feel that everyon should have health insur not  just a few peopl and no one should have to go bankrupt for medic bill the last peopl who reject by insur compani are abl to get it now i feel like some peopl get it and some peopl dont so peopl who need it the most final have a chanc to have insur  i dont see where everyon get what they deserv have problem with my mother in the nurs home  they are tie to get rid of her becaus of medic insur and cannot care for her home becaus she broke her in two place  in favor of tri to help everyon to get insur i feel like everyon should have health insur  i know peopl who dont have health insur have health problem cover those that dont have it everyon deserv health care not just the privileg  if our tax dollar go to up congress  they can go to the and sick too main your children can stay on your insur becaus everybodi should have access to health care a lot of peopl can get health insur i at a hospit and this would the child get the health care they need the insur compani have us over the and other industri nation do a better job with health care than we do with be a good it a good idea to get everyon insur everyon should have some form of insur it more peopl will be insur becaus of the law too mani peopl dont have health insur  need health insur i just thought it was anoth way to bring someth up  to get someth go to benefit the major of the peopl it will help a lot of the peopl in low incom in the long run and it will pay itself it a lot of peopl who dont have health care and i just think it would be for them that most peopl would not be use the emerg room for a doctor becaus theyll have health care the pre exist condit law i think it a good idea for everyon to have health insur give health care to peopl who never had health care befor  health care is the biggest in the us and it would be a step in the right direct i think it is go to provid the middl class and the low it is good for peopl to have health insur  im retir and im person pay outrag for the law famili member are benefit from it i think it a realli good start for the countri but it leav a lot of peopl without the servic that they need  becaus it allow peopl who cant afford insur to get it and it allow peopl who have pre exist condit to get it it doe help peopl who have not had health care befor becaus it will allow everyon to be insur  i think it good for everybodi but it has it and con becaus more peopl need to be cover by insur and the purpos of govern is to help the peopl everybodi should be abl to get insur it get health care to those who dont have it  im 26 year would be pay veri expens insur and this make it veri manag for me preexist condit  26 year old and everybodi pay in be subsid becaus it address the real problem  provid cheaper health care for peopl without it i dont need it at all i get all my medic through the va i think everyon should have the same opportun for the poor more peopl can access health insur we should get up to of other develop nation to provid afford health care it cover poor peopl and prevent them from use the emerg room as a first  you get more for the price main caus we need health reform i have no reason to find with it  if peopl are poor and cant buy food how can they be expect to get insur and pay a fine  i have friend that havent had health insur in the past and now they can it go to cost me more money  it give health care avail  make it afford for everybodi it favor the middl class i believ that no one should be turn away if they are ill or need medic attent regardless of if they have insur or not take care of each other as a of human be  i think everyon has a right to health insur everyon will receiv insur thing had to chang  the insur compani had a big hold on the american money ani way you go everyon has health care and will be look after becaus it will give access to more uninsur individu  becaus it is provid health for peopl who could not get it i realli dont understand it becaus it overal go to help peopl and insur more peopl main reason is it level the play field when it come to health care  peopl like myself with ill can now get health care and also it give better care to women  it unconstitut not up to the govern never been done befor the and problem along the way it cover the peopl who wouldnt be cover becaus i was off of medic leav and it benefit me  im insur  the cost of health care is so expens everyon deserv the right to have health care and if this is path to get it i am in favor of it the concept is veri good becaus now peopl who didnt have insur can get it it cover peopl with preexist condit give me the option to chose an insur plan free treatment i think that it is import for the number of peopl to be cover by insur becaus i think it fair and equal and doesnt increas between the 1 percent and the percent it will insur peopl who have had no health insur for  open opportun for those without insur i think a lot more peopl will sign up for it becaus all the peopl that dont have insur can get it at a lower price ive heard so much about it  thing ive watch on the news it is   we dont have health care that poor peopl can afford it will help those who dont have insur becaus it provid insur for peopl who arent abl to get it it assist peopl who dont have health care to have health care  when i was  i wasnt listen to the presid  but now i do  now there are lot of opportun and to be happi and healthi becaus i am abl to keep my health insur with my parent until age 26 it make sure that peopl that didnt have insur will now have it  becaus for peopl for appli it give them the abil to get health insur at an afford price there are way too mani uninsur american  i was one of them  and it provid an way for peopl get insur bring down the cost of medic there are peopl who are now cover that could not get insur becaus we need health reform it provid insur for those who dont have insur and cost for feder program it provid health insur to peopl who might not be abl afford or get it ani other way i believ it will help to provid insur for mani peopl who have not had the opportun in the past  i think theyr good to have   i believ in prevent care i think everybodi should have health care  i wish it could go through the way it was suppos to go through  good idea becaus it help those that realli cant help themselv it need to be fix glad everyon can get health care main becaus my insur didnt chang  it an effort to make health insur more avail becaus it go to provid insur coverag it the right thing to do the fact that it extend health care to more peopl in the us it good for the health and for peopl i work in educ and this is a for them  elimin of preexist condit in order to qualifi for insur  it extend health care to a lot of peopl that didnt have it befor everybodi should have a right to doctor and hospit everyon can have health insur becaus i know i went sever year and havent had it and i know how difficult it is to go to the doctor hospit  everybodi need health care i think it is the best law that could have been pass to make on the problem that are happen in our countri i had no insur for year and part of medicaid the program get more afford health insur becaus everyon should have medic care  some peopl need it or you dont it provid insur to those who are uninsur  someon who has a preexist condit cant be turn down or refus ive been watch and listen and the differ opinion on it and this is how i came to the  lot of peopl who dont have insur i think health care shouldnt be tie to whether your employ or not and i think were pay for everyon health insur alreadi so    becaus it help peopl that need health insur and have been deni insur becaus of preexist condit and i think that wrong ive have that experi as well  be deni is not american better access for peopl who cant afford health insur it put the respons on the individu and not the taxpay to provid their own health care servic becaus i as a taxpay shouldnt have to pay it becaus it the onli my husband could afford health insur i believ we all should have health insur i believ everyon should have a chanc at coverag it favor everybodi i have a who couldnt get insur befor and has it now becaus i am one of those peopl who could not get privat health insur becaus i had a pre exist condit and the peopl would not even with me and my sister went without health care until she reach age to get medicar elig  becaus it afford insur for peopl  they can  keep there kid on till theyr 26 year old becaus there are so mani peopl uninsur  but wasnt fair to the rest of peopl to pay the main reason is that i am pay about the same and i have much better coverag for me and my kid and my colleg student son can stay on my insur becaus it will give peopl do not have health care a chanc to get health care and we alreadi have govern run health care and it is call medicar and that has work for a long time and we paid for it hope it will be similar to what canada has becaus it afford all citizen health care becaus i know peopl who couldnt get health insur and they can now i think it help younger peopl who can remain on their parent insur becaus it is difficult for young peopl come out of colleg to find employ affect so mani peopl peopl without insur well that to reduc the health expens and everyon can get insur it a step in the right direct my son has a condit and i did not have insur  i was pay  80 for offic visit  now we have insur  the presid is tri to get american peopl to have health insur  it they dont we pay  the concept is good  i think basic the health care issu need reform for a long time  we need to have a way to get afford health care avail to all american becaus it intent to and health insur for all there been a whole lot of talk of good and bad i think it cover pre exist ill  keep peopl children under 26 still in colleg on their parent polici becaus it allow peopl to get coverag who was not allow at first but should be use a differ system low incom peopl can have insur if one doesnt have insur it not good  you go they ask for health insur and if you dont have it bad everybodi has the abil to get health care i think everyon should have some health option becaus i have health care now becaus it has it but it go to do it job that is a program for pay for than pay for becaus it help peopl who did not have ani insur in other word help the poor peopl becaus it give an opportun for peopl to pay for their own insur with tax payer have to pay for it becaus it provid insur for peopl who havent had health insur befor becaus we need heath insur for everyon  ani health care program in the countri is a plus  ani program that attempt to help peopl is a plus i think in my opinion the basic health coverag offer to the poor peopl will be good for them and the middl class probabl  becaus there a lot of peopl out there that dont have insur you cant get deni for preexist condit i think everyon should have afford health care coverag it there to help subsid the insur compani to cover the cost of elder medic becaus it for everyon to have and it use well for those who could not get insur for medic reason can now it get more peopl health insur  there no preexist condit not limit as far as money coverag for the purpos of health insur for peopl who cant afford it the idea work  it help peopl who cant afford it and peopl that do have job but cant afford to get their own insur  this would includ part time employe and other where i i think it a step to univers health care i agre with it and i think it was need to make health care access main becaus i think it is appropri that everyon has insur it cut the cost of health care becaus of the fact that it is exact go to be help peopl be healthier general reduc cost and add health care to those who previous didnt have it health care for peopl that need it and could not afford it befor  and how is it go to rais or lower rate for peopl that alreadi have insur  becaus it will have everyon with insur my son is an insur well intent you are no longer exclud form be insur for exist condit becaus it give everybodi the opportun to get health care i work with a larg amount of our countri that cant afford health care and im glad we final did someth they will help a lot of peopl becaus we i need it  just becaus my parent like most of what obama doe the law can onli get better  it cant get ani wors it good for the young peopl who need help and cant afford it well my had problem with insur and got it fix so it was veri help my sister has told me about all the benefit that come with it  the abil of children to remain under their health insur until 26 it save my sister dollar a month  it chang the bill that were alreadi made  now they are go over them now to see what they can chang  it good becaus it will help peopl that have no insur get insur  becaus i dont care im hear peopl are get health insur that even cheaper than what im get it for in case someon get sick and goe to the doctor i have a lot of peopl i know who have low incom and got afford health care just feel like it can cover for a lot of famili becaus everyon need to have insur becaus there are too mani peopl uninsur and it caus me to pay more for my health coverag the current system is a disast and the right is up down say that peopl who have insur that the coverag will not take care of them the is a good idea  give peopl a choic it will be help becaus of the success of the countri everyon need health care and without it we would have poor health care negat on famili  i think it just make veri good sens  we should insur all of our citizen cost all the civil countri extend coverag for young adult until 26  make health insur more afford i think it is benefici  otherwis some peopl wouldnt have health insur  it is benefici to the general public it help peopl everyon should have health insur  afford health insur just becaus we need health care for everyon in the unit state hope it will help peopl in the health care way everybodi need some kind of health care   i believ the unit state need a better health care system becaus the republican hate it and i it the afford plan provid for peopl with low incom everybodi can have access to health insur so i dont get fine by the govern i have 3 friend who die becaus of life time cap  and i am also between the age of 26  due to the health reform law  i have insur through my parent  without the law  i would not have insur  i think everybodi in the countri should have access to health care becaus we dont deni peopl health care at all i believ everyon should be abl to afford health insur  becaus it give peopl health insur i think health care cost are out of control and i dont feel you get the qualiti care for the cost  the elimin of preexist condit i believ it more of a govern  becaus i believ it is a social more equit polici a lot more peopl are abl to be cover by health insur  help school i think everyon will have insur  the law isnt perfect  i think it a step in the right direct for health care  so that peopl that cant afford insur can get it becaus i think everyon deserv a chanc to be cover by insur for surgeri and stuff someth come into effect and it a law  im a fan of it until someth happen and noth happen yet  it make health care better for american  it is embarrass the richest countri in the world to have the least cost benefit  the system is broken and need to be fix  i am in favor of more univers health care and i feel like this is one step closer to have the health care plan in the unit state that i feel like we should have more peopl will have medic care i had an oper last year and it bankrupt me so i think health care is a given and should not have to choos between bankruptci and live  well the need to have the opportun to get health insur our current system was clear fail and this was the onli solut  well here in it put over peopl were elig for medic benefit who werent befor  it help the poor communiti  it help us all  the cost we dont have to spend catastroph health care it good for the peopl with no health care some folk need insur and some folk have kid and the coverag they get i think it veri import that we make health care access to everybodi i think it will allow more peopl to have health insur and bring down the cost of health care i dont understand becaus it allow peopl who have never been cover befor to be cover i think it pretti good  my friend who are younger who got the obama care can now pay for it  need to move forward and implement it the right way offer health care access to

will includ more peopl who didnt have insur befor they allow me to get insur  was in and the insur cover it becaus everybodi deserv to have health insur whether they can afford it or not   and as a social worker  i have seen what happen when you dont  i just think it a good thing we have almost broken system in the welfar right now and we need a better system becaus health care cost is out of control we dont have a health care system i am general for the health care reform law as obamacar becaus the privat medic industri has this countri  i think it becaus itll help the american peopl who dont have coverag  afford  good for the economi the abil for more peopl to get health care i like some of the of the law take care of sick peopl  it a wonder thing i think it offer low price to peopl who need it most but it has a problem that is not access to everyon and the process to get is harder especi if your hispan becaus in the long run it go to includ peopl who are current not abl to buy insur i feel like everybodi should have the abil to get health care it help us all in medic servic becaus everyon deserv to have insur  becaus peopl that were unabl to get insur in the past are now abl to get insur everybodi to have health care think that everyon should have access to health care becaus it includ everyon  it much more around peopl get the health care they need rather than who

them more of their health and actual have an opportun to help themselv  help american who cant afford to get health care becaus i know a lot of peopl who have benefit  everyon should have health care i like to be healthi becaus i have been in and here everybodi is worri about their health care i think everybodi should have health insur i think everyon should have some kind of medic insur has a posit effect on mental health reform in my opinion the cost that peopl have to pay for their premium and depend on the level you might fall into one of those plan health reform is someth that has been talk about but not move on  it about time i think for a lot of peopl who have not been abl to afford health insur have been give them a chanc to help they need i like it  a way to help peopl get insur the open up avail to peopl a lot of benefit it our to insur those who cant pay for it themselv  it will cost less down the no reason the insur compani should not health insur if someon get an alien condit  you are not just entitl to health insur  you need to put into the system  becaus seem like no one can get good health care we need it  it is long over due  i feel like it should have been better  under peopl need insur the new health bill provid becaus now everyon will have some type of insur includ the poor and the low incom  it has more health coverag becaus i am a public health student and i research the health care reform in general everyon should be abl to afford health care more help to peopl who dont have their resourc i do believ we need some reform i think it a step in the right direct but doesnt go ani where as far as it should it give peopl better choic and of health care   whatev is good for the peopl peopl need insur they can afford i think it will help more peopl who cant afford health care we can stay on our parent health care bill until age 26  becaus there was no other way for peopl like my husband to get health insur  well i think the health busi realli need to be chang   too mani peopl cant afford pay insur plan right now and someth need to be done   the afford care act need to be test  it enabl me to keep up with my it seem like a good idea so mani peopl are out of work  their job dont pay enough to afford health care everybodi need it i think everyon no matter how much money they make or how they are should have access to basic health care my parent are favor of it therefor i am too it help peopl get insur who would otherwis not be abl to afford it  we can all use it  it someth veri import for our health  i think it should be human right to have health care becaus i can have coverag for the first time peopl can be insur and get the medic help they need it is need i believ it cover a group of peopl that were not abl to be cover befor that need to be cover  i think everybodi should have a chanc to buy insur i think it deserv a chanc i think that some chang was necessari be onli develop countri that had no health care i believ in the idea of the law make health care avail to everyon  i wish it was a more process  becaus we can no longer be deni insur if we job i think everyon need health care that hope everyon will have access to health care i appreci that the govern is tri to take care of it citizen and an that need to be chang it give everybodi the option to have medicaid without insur i like the idea of everybodi

with uninsur peopl who didnt have insur now have it it has increas the number of peopl that have insur becaus peopl need this this kind of health care i am hope it is the first step toward the singl payer for health care in america  this cannot be the end  afford care act should go further   i wish that we could elimin health insur compani as  so mani peopl who deni insur befor becaus i think more peopl should have access to good health care we need it  this countri is so behind with health care compar to the rest of the world  it embarrass  there has got to be some form of health care

to receiv health care i like obama becaus peopl dont have to die anymor just becaus they get sick  becaus i dont get a chanc to choos my own doctor colleg age kid that could still be cover until they got their own job and you could get insur now if you have a preexist condit i think there should be univers health care in our nation and this is one step toward it  becaus peopl need health insur becaus i have medic issu and i have to think about health in the futur when peopl are old and i need medicin for my health it make health insur access and give a reason rate i believ that good health is a part of be an american and that this bill allow a popul of peopl that were previous not allow to have health care to get it i think it serv a good purpos and if you give it enough time it will come around i realli believ that it help peopl  that peopl who would not otherwis have the health care that they need  govern provid health care now and it a good thing and other countri are do it make everyon has a health plan and make afford becaus it a step in the right direct  anyth that can help us right now is a plus as far as im concern the reason i support the health reform bill is one

cover a lot of peopl that couldnt afford it befor  i think everyon need to be cover to give more peopl health care in the countri  i dont like how it more to certain compani who are now make more money contribut to the econom gap  they cant afford it now becaus the compani have an they up their base on what i know regardless of econom status they should get a decent level of health care becaus someth had to be done and no one came up with anyth but him becaus it seem that a lot of uninsur peopl are not becom insur  it will even out the cost of health care for everyon  becaus everybodi deserv a right to good health protect so peopl can get insur who didnt befor becaus i think everyon need health care becaus i believ everyon is entitl to comprehens health care a lot of peopl have benefit from it  both black and  it is help more peopl in this state i want everybodi to have access to health care it is a step toward the right direct son have health issu  no job  too expens  more

they didnt have it befor  it provid health care who couldnt get health care  it allow peopl with pre exist condit to get health insur  it is make health care both more avail and more afford it appli to me it better than what we had befor  more peopl are abl to get health care so differ peopl can have insur becaus it help the middl class improv insur and improv access to insur i think it will reduc everyon cost in the long run and it also provid coverag for everyon in the unit state everyon need health insur becaus it would allow more peopl with pre exist condit to get health insur becaus

better for some peopl get peopl im a medic student and it is import becaus of the fact a lot are be laid off   main reason is it open up health care to peopl who couldnt afford it in the past and

the option for health care  becaus i get medicaid more peopl to cover becaus there are more benefit and coverag is more complet i think everyon should have health care but doesnt affect me becaus so mani more peopl that need health care can obtain it now it extend health care to peopl who couldnt afford and it help fair cost by help bring other peopl into the system the of get insur compar to befor in favor of peopl have a better chanc of get insur becaus peopl have more access to health insur but there is also price it help all kind of peopl get health care it allow more peopl to have

much rather them put peopl on medicar and medicaid becaus is not an answer befor the law i had no insur it better for low incom famili more peopl need to have access to insur everyon who wish to have health insur can have it like the need to be  the need to be    that about it  becaus it allow me to get health insur at an afford rate and befor i couldnt  becaus it can help a lot of peopl becaus

went on social secur and i have medicar i have not paid for anyth but my deduct   ive had lot of test and oper   i have a veri bad back and had about oper on it and i havent had to pay anyth on those   i think it give the american peopl option  some peopl need a littl help with their health care especi the elder my daughter is abl to get insur that she was not abl to get befor for her and her famili i think it a step in the right direct but the presid didnt make the right decis the health issu is not too bad i think it give most peopl access to health care who couldnt afford it befor and it got rid of pre exist condit and also it allow kid to be on their parent health insur until they were 26 old  becaus it provid health insur for peopl who couldnt afford it befor  middl incom peopl are help out quit a bit i just believ everybodi should have health insur health care need to be more access to everyon sound like a lot of peopl who didnt have insur now have it everyon can get health insur  didnt have anyth like this befor i think everybodi should have health insur help bring the price of insur down to make health more afford and insur more avail becaus through my employ i have insur so im becaus im poor and  i couldnt afford insur ani other way it give everybodi a chanc to be abl to get it becaus i think everybodi should have health insur and i think it should be part of what the general public is give  it open the door for a lot more peopl to afford insur  im sick and tire of peopl die from not have health care  i think it benefici for peopl who dont have insur and are unabl to  my famili is abl to take advantag of it  more afford health care sound good it provid health care to previous uninsur in america  it do a lot of good becaus it allow more peopl to get health care becaus if i ever have problem i want someon to help me out becaus we never had one i believ such a system is better for everyon in general  it is extend access with a littl more choic it seem like a good way to help out peopl in need becaus more peopl have health insur now than they had befor  it practic of insur compani  stop them from prevent servic to those with preexist condit  and lower the number of emerg room visit  it general not a good idea not to have health insur my wife use it and we were abl to afford a much better qualiti insur it is a good thing for everyon becaus i think too mani peopl in america go without health insur and it need to be more access for everyon everi citizen in america should have insur  becaus the presid is democrat and i approv what democrat do it forc insur compani to preexist heath insur and it will eventu bring the cost down  and help fund i believ everybodi is entitl to health care  i just dont like the way it was done health care afford without it i would not have insur  becaus befor we would go to the hospit they would not want to see us for not be insur and now that they are charg the care they provid is better becaus in there a lot of peopl who dont have insur and they a lot of money  no pre exist condit i dont think it was understood from the begin and i still dont think it is understood becaus so mani peopl dont have access to health insur now have health insur  it better than what we had and better protect  no preexist condit i believ that health care is a right that american should have becaus it can be good but cost  i think it is a way for everyon to have coverag medic cost are way too high for the averag minimum wage worker i think everybodi deserv health care and it a wonder thing for peopl who cant afford it they are interest in the elder health someth that go to be in the long run believ that everyon should be cover by health insur becaus are healthi you are more in line with and in with what to come i guess becaus it help you if you are not abl to afford health care save me money peopl can get it  it is good becaus they get to to with health it pay for itself i think too mani peopl

everybodi need health insur  you go to doctor offic and you get out of pocket expens that are ridicul insur more peopl  allow pre exist condit  and allow children to stay on their parent insur until

for peopl with littl money poor peopl who dont have insur need it i think it is good for the peopl that do not have health insur it help peopl that cannot afford health care especi like myself  not work it allow more peopl  all peopl  even those with preexist medic condit or are poor to have health insur there is a lot more peopl out there that it is help becaus it forc everyon to have health insur  those that werent abl to afford it befor can now afford it  offer to peopl who not have insur access to final have it chang what age to what age to be on parent health insur becaus peopl get insur  it use to in the past if you didnt have ani insur peopl would die  i think it is fair i feel like we shouldv had this law 100 year ago it to have increas health care coverag for more and more peopl in the unit state it give million of peopl the chanc to get health care  even with the subsidi the rate are still high it has given peopl health care that could not afford it  it is help more peopl get health care coverag but it has caus some peopl difficulti  it offer more access to health care  becaus i know it is import for peopl to have health care i need it and a lot of poor not abl to afford insur  everyon be abl to have insur we should have univers health care  it doesnt affect me i think it suppos to be give health insur to those that cant afford it or dont have it and i realiz that there are some hole or i guess fund issu in it which is whi i onli have a somewhat favor it good at least they are tri to get peopl health insur so everyon can have insur it a good idea it fair and reason and serv peopl across all status and it make us better than a third world countri in term of the qualiti of our health care access  peopl now have health care the reason i have heard peopl are well taken care of it give everi citizen the opportun free access to health  well it go to make health care more access to other peopl and cheaper for peopl everyon get insur so mani peopl have gain health insur as a result well  for one  there is no better right now  at least in the unit state   becaus it necessari becaus i can get health care when i couldnt befor kid get to stay on their parent insur health care should be access to all peopl not just the wealthi or the extrem  now everyon is elig for it and much need becaus the system we had befor was broken and this system  although it has it  allow more peopl to have coverag than there was befor  onli becaus im a retir person and i live out in the countri and i had to use the medic system and it work fine  it seem to be a step in the right direct  my famili financi situat  the fact that i havent been work in three year we were abl to get a plan i other opinion  expand insur for those who previous did not have it might make insur more avail to me and my husband i am in favor of more peopl get health becaus we have to have health reform  becaus   we need to have better access to healthcar in this countri  becaus i think peopl need healthcar and there so mani peopl without it  there need to be a public option so there is competit and that would lower health care rate  i am over 50 and and in a medic with a pre  exist condit and hope this will help me  becaus everyon should have a right to go to a doctor and get medic help  isnt the american about help everyon  it will cover peopl who dont have health care insur it help a lot of peopl   dont have to come out of their pocket with money as much  becaus it is across the board where those less fortun would have access to healthcar someth need to be done the presid  if he say it go to work i believ in him it was about time it think it on the right  but it still leav a lot of  peopl without insur  well  i dont know  consid my age and my health i figur i might need it  help million peopl who do not have ani insur obtain the insur  elimin precondit  in my understand it wont be abl to reject peopl insur avail for peopl with prior condit i have a child who has at age and she would have been kick off my polici at age and now she will be abl to stay on the polici the in co will not be abl to deni her coverag basic becaus we are self employ and we are hope that it will provid afford coverag the small busi owner and his famili it no way for thing to be enforc   medic  i believ that peopl should have a to health insur and  better access to becaus i think everi citizen should have a healthcar that is a legal citizen it they come over here think that everyon need good healthcar and get good healthcar better health care for american becaus it will be cover more peopl becaus i think it is absolut that we come up with a plan and i think this open up the in a serious way  i just think it the basic need that peopl have health care and it should be taken care of and it would save a lot of peopl an becaus i think we need it  becaus there are a lot of us that cant afford health insur  i feel like it will help peopl without insur to get insur  i have children  colleg student  who have to have coverag while in school  offer health care to peopl who cannot afford it everyon can have healthcar and help peopl who have pre  exist condit can be cover medicar onli pay a portion of peopl bill and then there is a and there are peopl who dont have insur at all  becaus i think everyon should have healthcar  that those who couldnt afford coverag can get coverag now  well i guess the way for me to it  it the first step in the right direct and i think we have a long way to go to get where we should do  to me it doesnt go far enough  i believ we should have univers singl payer healthcar it seem like a bill that would help a lot of peopl by cut their medic cost  provid servic for all   becaus of the way they dont want us to have our rate rais you can with no prior health concern becaus insur is so expens  a lot of peopl cant afford it  and i feel everyon should be abl to have health insur  i think it go to benefit the countri  becaus it take care of the peopl  i can get some new becaus we need health reform in this countri i think it includ more peopl that need health insur coverag i like and trust the presid  and it is about someth was done i like the fact that they are get rid of the preexist condit and health no longer deni for these condit 500 000 peopl die without health insur everybodi should have insur i hope it will make the health insur less expens and we are self employ and the health insur way over the top  we need to do someth right now i have relat that have medic insur  they have been drop and doesnt not have ani insur now  this countri need to take care of their peopl not the drug compani  i have a daughter go to school and she is cover by the new reform law   it good for everybodi a lot of peopl need to have insur  i am on medicar  but this will help those who have no insur well it a start  republican were not go to let obama start what he want becaus everyon that doe not have insur will be entitl to receiv it i will includ so mani more peopl that did not have insur befor provid health care for famili i like that it help low incom famili  it is a bill overal  peopl are get taken care of  go to help everybodi becaus i think their a lot of  that peopl need help i mean it help those who dont have health insur we have famili member with medic problem that could not get ani insur  it a step in the right direct becaus there is so mani peopl without health insur  we need to overhaul or chang the healthcar system i think everyon should have insur it would give health care to those who do not have it  everyon would have to have insur  i like have everyon has a chanc for insur i think there should be nobodi without health care insur  there are peopl without insur that s one to mani  it doe not go for enough to help peopl with health insur it give a chanc for insur to start  it is better a bad bill than none at all becaus peopl who dont have healthcar will now have it and get coverag we need reform  i believ everyon need health care and not everyon can afford it now that health care gotten so expens becaus i have 2 adult children w o health insur becaus of lack of job and everyon should have health care we health care reform in this countri  more peopl would be abl to get health care it go to help the peopl i like the presid  i like everyth he doe  i think it will help peopl that have no insur coverag  should help the cost of insur compani to go down  eventu im a medicar and am hope that it will not affect health insur becaus i think access to healthcar is veri import   healthcar is veri expens    well we all know healthcar is ridicul   peopl are pay thousand of dollar   i dont think it fair that peopl were against it becaus of who was push it  i think there need to be a chang made theyr go to make health insur more afford it go to help all of america get healthcar it hard to make sure peopl who are can take of themselv  good thing forc everyon to get insur like it becaus everybodi should be insur i think it go to help a lot of peopl in need  were on a budget  and money  money is the main reason  i think it will help us low incom peopl it give peopl benefit that are not abl to receiv benefit i think it will help more peopl that dont have insur get insur and it will help peopl that have pre exist condit to get insur and it will get tax cut for busi to get insur for their employe i think everyon should have access to healthcar  i think it is better than the current system  becaus someth need to be done i like the fact the govern is take a big roll in this becaus with ani it will save me some money becaus i pay an cost  my main insur is someth i have to pay for as well as my wife  with ani well get a reduct  it expand coverag doesnt allow for be drop for pre  exist condit  i like the way it agre with my need  hope that peopl with pre exist ill will not be turn down i like the fact that they cant deni anyon for pre exist condit  they are go to be work on medic expens  the peopl who dont qualifi for insur now  will be abl to have some with this plan  it is go to help peopl that do not have insur and they will be abl to get it now and therefor it will help everyon premium  becaus it is an improv for me and i have a precondit becaus their is lot of in the insur field becaus everyon should have insur basic becaus someth need to be done  let see how this turn out becaus it doe not take effect for anoth 4 year i like the fact that student can stay on their parent insur i think it will give health care for everybodi also think the cost of healthcar will come down i do as be a citizen that i need medic assist med help becaus there is a lot of peopl without insur who need it someth has to be done to improv our health care in america   it is not perfect but it is a start  like the fact that everyon will have healthcar becaus final we are do someth in healthcar  if we can get everyon healthi that what matter  becaus it will give a lot of peopl who dont have health coverag some health coverag  have a child under 20 and will keep insur till 26 it will cover more peopl i think that there is a lot of peopl who did not have insur and now they will have some insur i think everyon should have healthcar  becaus it is long overdu  there are too mani peopl unemploy and not have health coverag  there is mani uninsur peopl that need to have health insur  i realli believ that everyon should have health care and i think health care cost are out of control and insur compani have run everyth and we need to take back the power  i think it import that everyon get help when they need it  well i think it necessari becaus some peopl cant afford insur and it go to help them it is the best that we can get right now  we were hope for a singl payer system  i  think it is good that health care is avail to everyon but i dont know if our countri can afford this right now becaus there is no more pre exist condit  i am cover by my own insur from work but im glad it was pass just in case someth happen my wife has she work for and she is deni insur becaus a pre exist ill it about time the govern got into the health busi  there are too mani peopl without insur  allow other peopl to get insur it will control doctor and prevent them form take advantag of peopl lower incom it is favor  busi are unfavor it a step in the right direct  becaus a lot of peopl need help with health insur i cannot allow ani american not to have ani health insur   we still have to figur out how to pay for it  it is go to help a lot of peopl who can not afford their own healthcar and we all need it  30 million peopl get cover by it that didnt have it befor a lot of peopl can now get insur and cant be to prior condit i have adult children  and we are the work poor and they dont have insur  and they have health problem  and they themselv becaus they dont have the fund so this bill level the play field thing are right now but we need to have reform right now becaus peopl cant afford it and the peopl who oppos it can afford it more at ani rate  we have govern insur so we are fine  health cost are out of control and they have to do someth about it too mani peopl without health insur is caus problem i think we are in a in health care in this countri and it will requir govern intervent in order to provid afford care for most american peopl need insur it will help young peopl find health insur easier it go to bring the cost of health coverag down   my wife is cover under it but im not im under the va i think it been need and happi that the presid sign into law everybodi need health insur i think we need some insur reform so peopl can not be exclud becaus of past medic and that young peopl can stay on their parent polici till  and i would like to see it start  i think everi person should have health care  it is a start but there should have been a option precondit are gone and donut hole is gone i am not sure what it will mean in the long run and it sound good to be true  it would help a lot of peopl who make a minimum wage  becaus i have the law and it has some i like  i like the fact that everyon is go to be cover the low incom cannot afford to see the doctor  and they dont have the opportun to see the doctor for year  move in right direct   one step closer to univers singl payer were their onli industri nation in the world that doe not provid healthcar  peopl with no insur can now afford insur becaus i believ it import for everyon to have access to healthcar i think anyth that will keep cost and insur compani under control is a big benefit  i think we have so mani peopl in realli bad and it is respons for the govern to do so they dont die without care and so that they have some kind of coverag i believ everyon should have the opportun to have health care and not everyon now doe have it   and if we dont do someth now our health care situat will turn into the same thing as our econom situat  that is depend on public fund an at this point better than noth and we are behind everi other civil countri in world 30 million more american have health insur it go help children until age 26  no pre exist condit  i am retir age and i am unemploy and have no insur i like the fact that kid up to 25 can get it and no precondit at the time that i do listen to the news if it toward help everybodi then i am favor  and if it is not go to benefit anybodi then no  my wife and i believ in help everybodi  it got to benefit all the kid and not just certain kid  when it need  it go to help us becaus i was abl to take advantag of one of the reform   my husband is unemploy and i have insur  35 million will get healthcar  no pre exist condit becaus if it help  and i assum that it was it was go to do   i know there are a lot of peopl who dont have health in and  cant afford it well i believ someth had to be done  for the peopl who where uninsur  becaus i believ the health insur need to be chang  i went from an individu polici to a group polici  i had individu polici for mani year but when wife chang to group i could not get ani insur and none of other who found out coverag for preexist condit becaus it put into law some need reform societi need to care of member health care should be  to everyon  it is time we follow the rest of the world and provid coverag for everyon in the u s  more 35 million peopl who are not insur we  definit need a health  reform law  and was not success put through in the administr  someth should have been done ago it not perfect but it a good work  i the politician who have put it into place im good with someth that will benefit all  no one should be left out   expand coverag for uninsur it will probabl help other peopl who do not have health coverag  proper medic care and help peopl with pre exist condit becaus i feel that a lot of peopl have work hard most of their live and have lost everyth they have work for becaus of one health issu  also the health care system  their interest has been more profit then   it could be better  but at least 40 million peopl will have health care  mass  we all readi have it here    this allow everybodi to have health insur   i work for senior and will elimin the donut hole which is a huge issu for those on a fix incom  i think it is to help younger peopl get health insur becaus i think there are a lot of peopl who dont have insur will be abl to afford insur and it will get rid of the whole for senior  becaus health care is a and there was no way to equal health through this path it suppos to make it easier to get health insur  present system is in troubl and this will help   not as good as i hope  but better than noth  feel need to have coverag  good way to start it is good for middl class america of health insur for the insur it not perfect  but go to help a lot peopl  i am 65 and it seem favor for me   i feel it is in my favor it will provid a lot more health coverag for more peopl the old system was not good need a chang   ani chang to get the roll is good someth need to be done in this countri  there are too mani peopl without coverag  someon is put an effort for someth to be done it will cover some peopl that dont have coverag  less well off well i think all peopl need health care even unemploy peopl  everybodi should have health care except the illeg in this countri i knew too mani peopl that dont have health insur and have a catastroph ill and were unabl to cover the cost  i think this new health reform law will help those that dont have health  insur  ne it will increas the avail of health care to more american when it right it right i dont believ i should be respons for  all peopl to have in gov should not have that much control to tell you to have insur all peopl should have health in but i should not be respons there are a lot of peopl who can not afford health insur  some peopl do not make enough to afford health insur becaus the system that we had was so mess up and we need reform  from my own experi as a small busi owner i had to find my own insur  they didnt cover what they were suppos to cover and i was and under cover  m in favor of it if it help peopl it will help peopl get health care that don t have it now  i think too mani peopl do not have medic and we need it   the insur compani are rip off   premium are high and servic is poor  becaus need to be someth done i  think insur compani has been treat peopl bad for year and i think they need to be prevent from cancel peopl insur when they need it the most  rais rate  and refus insur base precondit  the health reform help you get health care with pre exist   condit there are million of peopl in this countri without health care and this reform help address that issu  becaus i dont have ani healthcar  i have never been abl to afford insur and the new reform bill will help me to afford it  a lot of peopl need health no other reason expans of servic and increas access to health care to current those who do not have it  help to provid coverag for peopl who dont have it i think it is someth that it necessari    i dont think it goe far enough it still favor the healthcar insur compani they need to be control so that they cant drop peopl and rais the rate to an level give more coverag becaus i think that peopl need to have more control  doctor and that have to much control  i think by the govern do it doctor wont have so much control  in compani should not be abl to drop peopl on their diseas in compani should not be abl to give some help within reason for preexist help problem as a is exist and a problem and someth should be done especi in the i dont like to think that peopl have no medic coverag  societi mean that you care for and about your man  have to control with medicar medicaid  control abus of it  set up more benefici to more peopl congress is corrupt and final congress is do someth to help peopl it fill the gap where peopl need health insur i think that it a good start go in the right direct to the health insur system and solv some problem health system need to be fix  mani uninsur we need univers health care it should provid insur for more peopl overal i think it will help peopl basic to keep the insur compani in check i think peopl need it  i think there are too mani peopl that dont have insur  i think everyon deserv insur  i think more peopl need health insur becaus there too mani peopl in this countri with no insur  someth has to be done about health reform i want the public option i think it go to help senior citizen get certain form of healthcar w o be reject for previous condit i think that peopl should get insur  about the reform  mix i am a nurs and i daili see the of what happen to peopl who do not have health insur and who get health insur or health care   i have children who have do not have health insur and so they have no way to protect becaus deni insur to peopl with an exist condit is wrong and the system is wrong no real reason i have at this time i might chang mind soon most for the elder peopl that do not have ani health insur  i think that healthcar need to be reform  it step and we can continu to move forward i like the fact that colleg can stay on insur plan longer till they find a job  i it was import to get someth done my son doesnt have health insur  i think this health reform will help him get access there is a lot of peopl that need it that dont have it  i have a good health insur and i feel for the one that dont i think insur compani are too expens becaus it will give help care to more peopl then had it befor  it will allow more peopl to get health care then befor  i just believ that everybodi should have health care  i think this new health care reform get thing start in the right direct  ne if it help all peopl it would be favor becaus health is own by insur compani in my opinion we should have a singl payer system and there should no profit i think it need to be over and more peopl need to get health insur  everyon need some type of insur  we help other countri out and our are not cover so we need to cover everyon  becaus i think it go to work i think it go to take a few year  i think general it a step in the right direct  to give health coverag to 30 million peopl who have not had it in the past i believ that all peopl should have health insur just like you must have car insur it will help the middl class get insur and maintain exist insur polici  no profit or administr cost need  we need singl payer i think that medic bill are too high and it is good that peopl are be requir to obtain health insur it will cover peopl who do not have health insur it will elimin donut hole for senior i believ everi human be on this deserv health care  i believ this new health reform is a step forward  ne it give all american resourc to obtain medic insur treatment  becaus everyon will have health care becaus their a lot of adult and children without health insur that need treatment  becaus we all should afford health care becaus we all cannot pay high price simpli becaus a lot peopl dont health insur  medic world need medic attent becaus there

new reform law i will be abl to have one becaus it go to give more peopl the opportun to afford heath care it go to give us all an opportun to get health care i think it is good they want to give the peopl without health insur some so that way more peopl will be abl to go to the doctor when need  we will all have coverag for our health it go to help peopl with low resourc obtain health care  becaus it would give mani unemploy peopl a chanc to receiv health care at a reason price it help get insur for everybodi my kid will have health insur with this new law i dont know much about it but it sound like there is go to be a lot of peopl that will now have insur this will hope help my children receiv insur and go to the doctor more  becaus it go to be a lot of peopl with medic coverag it tri to address problem in the healthcar system becaus i think the plan would help out a lot of the uninsur as well as the insur if we just give it a chanc i think it would help us all by give those that dont have healthcar a chanc to get it at a afford  cost more peopl can get health insur now it will be a lot more peopl cover  now i can go to ani doctor i choos it is mandatori for employ to offer healthcar to employe  all peopl are entitl to healthcar  there just too mani peopl without insur i think it is good for everyon  i think peopl need it that dont have it  becaus the insur will cover a lot of my hospit bill i just think that it would be better for all of us especi for the peopl who are suffer with major ill and cant pay for their treatment i have a child and it veri import  i think this countri should provid health care the way other countri do now i am abl to get the health care i need for my famili without have to go broke there is a chanc that everyon will have health insur  i believ it will provid much need help for some peopl  becaus it give everi american the opportun to get healthcar i think everyon who doesnt have healthcar is entitl to have it as american   i feel all american should have health care  that bill was pass to help lower incom   the elder and other american afford the healthcar that we need and i am in favor of anyth that help us everybodi should have access to afford medic healthcar peopl will get the much need assist that they have been long for    i feel that everybodi should have to right to have health care and if you dont have an employ to cover it then i dont want my next door to not be abl to go to the hospit if he is hurt  i think everyon should have health care  it is about time  this countri start tri to take care of it own  this way those who work hard and tri to make a live for themselv and their famili dont have to worri about not be abl to afford health insur  everyon should have healthcar   it time for chang  i have a diseas and if someth happen to my insur it is good to know i cant be reject ne i think it make peopl other thing over their health everyon need healthcar  and under privileg peopl need health care  i am go into medicin and i believ that the major of american lack appropri or access healthcar my make me want to take care of as mani peopl as possibl and i think this will help if you dont have no health insur what do you suppos to do  there and die  i will soon be a independ need health insur  more peopl will be cover and peopl will lose their job and not the insur  afford health care reform was need i think our countri should be cover by health insur when peopl cannot afford it should make insur more access to those without it now i believ it will allow for greater access and afford for all american  it will give peopl a chanc that cant afford healthcar to have it  the healthcar plan will be cheaper than befor i have been unemploy for a while and dont have insur but that hasnt stop me from need to go to the doctor and from what i understand the new law will make it easier for me to get coverag until i can find work  becaus a lot of peopl cant afford healthcar and prescript right now  this bill will help everyon becaus everyon need health insur peopl cant be deni insur for pre exist condit i like the on discrimin on pre exist condit for children i like the new and the on chang after purchas more regul hope better access and low insur payment think that it is aw for those who dont have in  medicaid pay for more of our medic  most peopl can get health insur now that couldnt afford it befor i think chang was need becaus insur compani are it tri to get everyon cover everyth it sound like it will help peopl becaus i know a lot of peopl who dont have health care and this will help them get free health care ne  it will lower health cost  and i will have lower out of pocket cost  everybodi should have healthcar i think it will help more peopl that cannot afford health insur  becaus a  lot of peopl can go to the doctor now   it will help american to get coverag i think it will be benefici to my famili and i  and not sure in what way yet but we will find out soon   becaus it a good idea and it will help the one that uninsur  i feel it was time for the countri to take a stand and help insur to becom more afford  i believ that all american should have health care it is good in one way i like the provis where the insur compani cannot cancel you or tell you cant have insur becaus of a pre exist condit it a good thing  it give everyon the opportun to have health insur that normal couldnt afford it becaus it just what we need  it open the door for a lot more peopl to get help and it help with a lot of peopl who has never had health insur befor  i like the fact that it help the senior with their medic coverag  p  it open the door for peopl to get healthcar  i feel like everyon should have healthcar regardless of their incom  it give everybodi the chanc to get some kind of insur i have a favor opinion becaus there is no longer a precondit   put a lot of strain on the in i think it will make healthcar more afford it help everybodi becaus peopl have been on the premium  peopl that have been on their job mayb and that as a pre exist condit when they go for insur    becaus it is a lot of peopl out here with no insur  your countri need to step up heard it is suppos to help with my medic coverag and the hospit are suppos to be abl to assist you no matter what and also the is not suppos to refus you i think it is a that a countri like the us i like the thought that peopl that do not have healthcar will be taken of in some form  more peopl will be abl to get healthcar now becaus everyon need healthcar  becaus we are extend coverag to a number of peopl which will cost save  i work in the medic field and the number of peopl that are come in now would not have come for the same reason this time a year ago we need afford health care becaus it cover pre exist condit everybodi will have insur if it doe what it is suppos to do we will see a big chang in patient care we final got someth to happen to start this countri go in the right way  back up top i think it will benefit the countri onc everyth is implement  i feel that it could help me and my famili out a great deal in our current situat with health care it give uninsur  peopl the chanc to have their health and well be  care for without worri  this law will everyon to equal and fair healthcar becaus i went without health insur for year so i know what it is like to need and not be abl to afford it  becaus everyon should becaus i think everyon need to have the same healthcar i know it will help a lot of american who do not have insur   it long over due   i think obama is push a good thing the whole communiti will be great impact by this law so mani peopl didnt have health care and the insur compani should be in some i think it would help everyon to be abl to afford health care    provid insur for those that didnt have it becaus if it wasnt for my wife insur i wouldnt have none   peopl who didnt use to afford health care now will be abl to but tax will rise  becaus everi one the opportun to get health insur equal opportun for everyon   for the most part it will benefit colleg age children and their parent     better coverag for major of the citizen i feel all american citizen should have coverag    i dont think it will affect me serious   i have good coverag through my employ i think the new health care reform project will help peopl all over the world  it will make health care more afford  great for the communiti poor peopl should not have to suffer becaus they cannot find afford healthcar   lower class peopl should benefit great  it will help the elder maintain and keep their current insur coverag  will help the countri as a whole   i feel all peopl should have healthcar  other countri are do it and it seem to work  i think it take the countri health care system in the right direct it put somewhat of a fix to our corrupt health care system increas avail becaus we have so mani uninsur peopl who need it and can get cover and help them   so peopl without healthcar can mayb receiv some form of healthcar     becaus it can help the peopl who could not afford health insur for them and their famili  it will help peopl be abl to afford health care   becaus im one of those peopl that heath care reform will help out  everyon cant afford healthcar  becaus there is peopl in this countri that need health insur that doesnt have it  i think there need to be some step taken to take care of the public and keep the cost down  i get to stay on my parent insur until i colleg  everybodi get health care so the peopl who do not have insur can mayb afford some type of insur  all american should have health care  i think all of the uninsur will benefit  so low incom american can afford health insur  it will help peopl all over the world  i think it a good idea for all american should be cover with the medic bill be so high and it could make it drop  peopl will now have health care more afford  it will help the low incom peopl like myself becaus it is go to help me and my famili to get good health coverag  it will give peopl that are uninsur health coverag i think it go to be more afford it will allow children to stay on the same plan as their parent after the age of 18 it will help the peopl from low class and middl class to purchas healthcar  for a healthier countri becaus there are a lot of peopl in this countri that need health insur and do not have it healthcar will now be avail and afford to everyon who wish to have it  it will give lower incom famili a of mind when it come to have afford healthcar becaus a lot of peopl in this countri need health care and they  do not have it now everyon will be abl to have health care coverag    afford healthcar for everyon it is final done and both side will and make it work been a need for improv in the health system  privat compani have not done anyth to help everybodi deserv health care countri should provid citizen health care becaus peopl that dont have that much money can get health insur easier everybodi has a right to access to health care our health system is veri ineffici access to health care for those that need it i think it need an overhaul  it need to be fine in general it has given more to medicar which seem to be do better this year it open insur up to more peopl becaus my is self employ and not insur   and we might be abl to afford health in i think everybodi should have health insur  i make sure that i have medic protect everyon need health insur  it provid more health insur for peopl it go to lead more peopl to get insur and wont be tie have through employ main becaus it doe give health care to famili  they stop insur compani from throw you off the plan due to a prior condit well becaus i feel it unfair to not get health care if they do not have a job  or if you dont have health care i am on medicar and we need to care of our peopl and our futur children includ everybodi univers health care is someth everyon should have becaus it provid health coverag for peopl who cannot afford it and the law give them a place to go everybodi should have health care and go to the hospit and be help more peopl are cover than the previous plan i think especi littl kid everybodi should be abl to have health insur and i think a pre exist condit is ridicul they wont insur if you have high pressur or cancer and that wont be cover it cover those with exist problem  it afford im  our govern need to take  better care of it senior becaus in this countri right now we realli dont have a good health law and ani chang we make is good and will be better than we have right now the fact that it there  peopl wont buy it for themselv becaus there are so mani other thing that are import to them and their health is down in the i would like to see everybodi have insur and to help senior citizen i think in general it go to help peopl who dont have the money for insur i like that it doe away with exempt of insur for pre exist condit pre exist condit for peopl who dont have it  congress in general  just whole not care of everyday person includ everyon  univers coverag i think it is fair for everyon i think it cut down cost for emerg visit you have some peopl that have no insur and you have some peopl that need the heath care  i got to visit the homeless  there is a lot of peopl that had noth on current assist  i never knew how mani until i the homeless peopl i am in the health care field and i think it is aw that everyon doe not have coverag  peopl die in this countri becaus they do not have coverag we pay lot of tax for other peopl  cant get help for diabet child   hope for help we need to have coverag for everyon the fact that it cover everyon i think it help a lot of peopl i dont think health insur should be a for  profit industri  get rid of life time cap they have laid out all the posit thing about it and i agre with that becaus my children will now be abl to afford health insur becaus it will give health care to peopl who cant afford it and i was in this posit at one time  when children leav home you cant get help  no medicaid  no noth take care of more peopl who do not have insur now it too for the financi part of the law becaus it way past well it time we had chang  i like that it is more avail to other peopl who cant afford it   i am hope that there will be more option avail for everyon i think it help peopl that realli need insur equal the play field there are too mani peopl without insur  most of europ and canada have insur it give coverag to those who have previous exist condit it allow everi citizen of the usa to get health  care which is a veri good thing becaus i need the money for insur it real good the abil to keep peopl on health insur for longer   more peopl to have it i read a bit about it  will forc employ left open to employe  will help to gain access to health insur that everyon would be cover becaus everyon deserv health insur  i dont think univers or socialist medicin is a bad idea becaus i think the and doctor are of lose money  i think poor peopl need insur coverag becaus i work for a live for year and i want the govern to start pay me it make sure more peopl are cover will help american it give more peopl a chanc to have insur i like   good provis for the health of children to age of 26 and it will forc all to have insur and keep peopl from use the emerg as the primari medic care  attent it enabl more peopl to have access to health care  it allow children under 26 to remain on their parent plan becaus even though it a small group of peopl who will have insur who have insur who werent abl to have insur befor  it still an improv it gave peopl health insur who need it i think our nation need a reform in health care peopl need it that do not have health and medic health care should be avail to everybodi it cover a major of american and creat the requir that you cannot be due to preexist condit i cant stand the health care industri right now and i dont qualifi for health care right now insur compani have not fix the problem that exist becaus we need it we need it and everyon will be cover and now there is a lot of peopl without health insur what we have go is not work just becaus i want more afford health care it help parent of children in colleg   it can continu the insur coverag and the pre  exist condit have been out and will lower premium  not big deduct   it is a start to help peopl afford insur pre exist diseas are cover  they cant deni peopl coverag  colleg are cover through their parent polici till age  26 becaus it will help peopl like myself becaus it will make insur compani pay what they are suppos to be pay becaus we need health reform law in this countri  we are tri to do someth it help peopl in the us have health care coverag and increas cost it will help consum everybodi will be entitl to health insur  afford insur to help the poor peopl everyon get the abil to get some kind of medic coverag it help my grandchildren the current system is unfair and we need reform the of health care in this countri make health care more afford his job i think a lot of peopl need health care who cant afford it becaus it concern health and that a concern with everybodi  help peopl without health insur  take them out of the polit and provid them with someth that will help peopl improv qualiti and decreas health care cost good for peopl someth has to be done  govern creat situat becaus i someth had to be done and i was happi somebodi did someth  i think the main thing is now everyon can get insur even if they have a pre exist condit and befor the insur would not give insur le a mucha  it give benefit to mani person it about time someth was done to make thing more fair i think everybodi need to be cover by medic i believ everyon i believ it a more independ choic becaus everyon need to have health care becaus i dont like our current health care system  i also think the one is better than our current system i come from a countri where health care is free to everyon becaus it is free and it for peopl who dont have health insur it benefit a lot of peopl i want everyon to have the same opportun to have health insur so low incom peopl can have health insur becaus im on a lot of medic and i onli have to pay 100 when theyr normal  for some it save money make all peopl elig for health care  afford my daughter almost die becaus she didnt have health insur i believ everyon should have health care becaus im tire of not have ani insur and i dont work and insur is too high to pay out of pocket health care would be more afford everyon need health insur and this is the way to have it done it was one of the best idea that will help out the day societi health care in our countri is a mess and those who realli need it dont have access to it like they should it an initi for signific chang  i feel it a right not a privileg  it should not depend on who can afford it health care is a human right that everybodi should have health care i cant explain but my answer is veri favor even though it is onli what obama start with  it is a move in the right direct it is extend coverag to more peopl becaus it make it possibl for everybodi to have health care  becaus everi american deserv to have health care i believ in univers coverag chang is need it was go to happen anyway i think we need to ensur that everybodi have access to afford health care peopl need to be abl to cover the children i feel that the insur compani need to in control and back into our hand   most peopl alreadi have it  coverag for the previous uninsur the rate of deduct is get higher and higher  mayb it will put a stop to it well they have univers health care  it is a good health care system  it is help and peopl without insur and peopl take job that they hate and need the insur  we have too mani peopl without insur  my son doesnt have a full time job and he will be 50 this and has no insur becaus the insur compani cant refus to insur peopl  i think that it target the rich basic becaus everybodi need some kind of health law it will benefit everybodi and it will reach out to everi class just to help other i have coverag overal becaus when everybodi pay  even a littl  it more fair the health care is for everybodi becaus it cover million of peopl that werent cover  it not cover but i the republican it insur more peopl becaus it help everybodi it good for everybodi who live in the unit state becaus mani peopl did not have health insur and get prevent care i think there should be more health reform in the countri and cover as mani peopl as possibl becaus it will cover more peopl that need it  it a step in the right direct a lot of peopl can get medic coverag i feel like it not a law that will not benefit everyon  it help everyon have insur there are so mani peopl who come into the emerg room that have no insur and we cant turn them away it allow more peopl to have access to health care i think there should be greater health care coverag than there is right now   there need to be chang  more regul on compani i have coverag and it doesnt cost a lot of money becaus there are far too mani peopl who are without health care and it someth that should be address  peopl shouldnt die becaus they dont have money if you can get health care for that amount of money that is good  year is great idea if it work becaus it go to bankrupt and it will eventu have to be it go to cover everybodi becaus ive been consid uninsur at a time it depend on the situat it give health insur to peopl who cant get it it forc everyon to get health coverag not be cancel  the year old get insur from your parent we will get better health care  becaus it will help other peopl to get health care it one step toward univers health care becaus it increas access to health care becaus it too much big govern tell you what to do becaus it help peopl to get health insur someth realli need to be done  the system is realli broken becaus i feel that the health system is so mess up and it need to be fix  the health reform law is a start becaus i think health care is a right and i think all peopl should have access to health care  main becaus you can stay on your parent insur until the age 26 i think the system in general need reform becaus  we wish for the singl parent  i dont think it should profit driven  if your uninsur or insur you should insur that cover major surgeri becaus it has direct effect my health insur in a good way becaus it set for better health reform to come  it help some peopl not to pay so much money  it will enabl peopl without health care to obtain health care becaus i think the health care is too expens and bring the cost down for peopl to have becaus i think it will help a lot of peopl get health insur so they will not be by a financi burden  i dont think that health should be a for profit thing  i think everyon should have the right to get health care and we should find a way to fund health care   becaus we need one i have not had to get off into it to know it is i just dont understand it  primarili it still give you a choic but it put everyon in the same field   peopl that are unemploy and employe that dont have insur with their employ  the govern will sell medic insur cheaper and improv the donut hole for medic and elimin pre  exist condit so you can get insur i think peopl should pay for their health care not get it for free   i am happi they pass the law becaus a lot of peopl are and cant afford to go to the doctor  becaus i believ everyon should have health care becaus it is expens i think that peopl should have access to coverag if they are unemploy or self employ and the health reform bill doe that  becaus the insur compani rate are too high and peopl need help   becaus im afraid peopl around the countri will get health care with it i think it was a good idea i think the nation has the and everi one is  entitl to it no one should be deni servic and there should be no pre  exist condit some of the stuff becaus were both senior and we have some strong medic and it has help us a lot i like the idea of it and i worri about my famili and other futur i just dont think they should spend so much money on it  i think the health reform in this countri is bad and the chang is better than what we have had in the past  i think it will our qualiti of health care i just think the insur is not afford  keep the kid on insur till age 26 and they cannot be cancel becaus of bad health issu  i think that the insur an situat they have made it imposs for us to get the care that we need becaus we need a chang in the health care industri  i realli dont much about it but it allow our colleg age kid to stay on our insur until they get 25 year old  year old are now cover also we need some kind of coverag i think everi one should have health insur i think everyon should be abl to have health coverag and i think the health reform bill provid that  eventu bring down the total cost of health care to the countri it open up insur for most peopl who normal wouldnt be abl to get it becaus the peopl who cant afford health insur can get better help i realli like get rid of the expect for peopl who have pre exist condit  also that you can keep your famili on a littl longer there seem to be a way for more peopl to have coverag  the congress has the best health care in the world  everyon should have the same for the simpl reason they have a lot of elder and poor peopl who realli need it it will help a lot of peopl it will provid assist to peopl who realli need it most design for low incom peopl becaus i pay high premium for my health insur becaus we need univers health care becaus most of the peopl that need insur are not abl to get it  becaus i think for it to cover everyon the onli way for us to have everyon cover is to have everyon buy health insur becaus it allow parent to cover their children  up to age 26  they attend well i feel that it is go to save a lot peopl who cant afford it it long past due and we need to be more in treat their general list becaus it make it possibl for the poor peopl to be abl to see the doctor becaus i think it time that everyon has health care  i think peopl should all have health care they expand the insur age up to 26  offer but not requir insur for all peopl need medic coverag and if obama has to cut head to make peopl get proper care then so be it i think it a lot of peopl will benefit from it it will get access to peopl who has pre  exist health problem it will help some peopl becaus we have a need for it  we we have a lot of uninsur peopl in this countri who need the help  health care system was cost everybodi way too much money    one of them is that the kid can stay on until their 26 and the other is peopl with pre exist condit can stay on the insur  they cannot be exclud caus whatev their condit es favor para todo los que tener seguro medico  it is favor for all those who want to have medic insur i think it help peopl to help themselv get health care insur i feel what the presid is do is tri to help us with insur it someth that we definit need but if they could make it afford for everyon i would be 100  for it becaus i am a person with disabl and i believ all peopl have a right to health insur becaus it provid health insur to peopl who do not have becaus it is unfair to elder  they are on fix incom  they cant afford it to by their prescript medic  it make it much higher and sometim they cant afford to buy their medicin becaus it provid continu coverag for depend children  it work to provid health care for peopl who dont have it  well i think that everyon should have a health plan  the homeless and everybodi els  the low incom peopl and all   import that everyon has health insur i like certain part of it like make the peopl pay and not the doctor  we pay to get well it will be good for those that it appli to   i think it will help some peopl with their health care  becaus we have need univers health care for a long time i feel that our health care system is in terribl  becaus i support the fact everyon will get help or some type of health care becaus  i have paid for health care for year so older peopl can get the health care  i think it import for everyon to have access to afford health care and that what the law bill doe  becaus i believ that univers health care is veri import and i think that the health reform bill make it a step closer to make that happen   it provid great benefit for older and younger peopl  becaus their is too mani peopl who do not have health insur and the need it  it help insur peopl that never had insur  i think it a good idea for peopl who got health care  everyon should be abl to go to a doctor or hospit everyon can have a health health care need reform and it need to be nation   we need a nation health program  becaus i have been in a situat when i didnt have health insur and now i do   might help better in our health care it give peopl a chanc to get insur under these econom time  at least we have medic coverag  we need a solut to the problem  this is the best that is avail so far  they need to think more about the senior citizen and children that mean that now more uninsur peopl will now have coverag  attend all no matter what the health reform law is design and will serv the averag peopl as well   it requir of of compani peopl with exist condit can get coverag becaus i hate and i want to do away with health insur compani  everybodi should be abl to get health care when they need it becaus our medic and co pay will be at an afford price becaus my kid and my famili are cover by insur i think it is a step in the right direct becaus i think it is import that everyon get benefit  when i didnt have benefit i realiz how import they are with the way that thing are run now in u s  it would be nice for peopl to have health care and have our peopl be taken care of  becaus there are too mani peopl that dont have health insur and they should have it it give million of peopl help becaus i am a poor colleg student we cannot leav a of peopl without health care becaus it help peopl with no insur becaus i believ health is a right  i singl plan  it a start we need some kind of health care reform becaus it a chang that has been need  everyon can get help there is a lot of famili without coverag that realli need it becaus it cut out a lot of thing for the lower class we need to have some insur everyon get access to health insur an effort has been made to chang health care for peopl that dont have it i think it help for colleg student everyon should have one no matter what your financi status and dont need anyon in the congress to tell that i dont need afford health care insur mandat is a good idea i think that there need to be univers health care and everyon should contribut becaus it aw for peopl to go the emerg room and pay high price  the govern is final tri to help the and the lower incom peopl by let them get the insur it will help a lot of peopl becaus a lot of peopl are uninsur and unemploy  i think it will be benefici to mani peopl i dont know much just like the law  cover everybodi and requir everyon to i feel everyon need health care well i am disabl and i do use doctor i dont know what it cover becaus medic is an and medicin cost a lot of money and everyon need some kind of health care  becaus i support obama the health care system is in and we need to support the system  becaus i work for the ir and  bankruptci caus by peopl who did not have insur this bill allow peopl to have health insur it help peopl   in my own word i feel privat insur compani dont have the best interest in their own  it allow everyon to have some kind of health care servic i think it good to have a health bill make sure everybodi get health care we are final seen govern is spend the money on health care instead of someth els i believ everyon need adequ health care i do like that it has provid insur to more peopl but i wish that it did more health care avail for everyon i realli dont know that much about it to give opportun to more peopl  becaus i have a who lost her in a car and now she has medicar and  becaus we all should have some kind of health insur and most of american need help pay for it  it put thing into play that wasnt there befor and peopl to buy insur i believ in univers health care for all it help me with my medicin i think that the third law was not previous set up but this law is go to take care of the peopl as far as i know health benefit under medicar have improv and the medic have improv i think a lot of peopl need it  i like the assist they are give us but im  not sure of i understand everyth i dont of it becaus there are peopl out that need health care and cant afford it becaus in canada and europ they have a healthier  it is better than what we had befor i think it veri much need  i work in health care 35 year  becaus everyon should have health insur  peopl need more health care it need to be cheaper  they take good care of your bodi by give med and doctor visit  extend the health care for young adult i think it would improv and there are some peopl who suffici insur  i just think they have better coverag for medic and disabl peopl and peopl on medicar and medicaid need to be improv and drug coverag need to be improv i believ too mani peopl lack health care and we need to insur low incom and uninsur american  make health care afford   we will now have more help with health care it move peopl away from have to use emerg room for their primari care to have insur  i like the fact that children and student can stay on their famili insur until age 26  i like the fact that it doe away with pre exist bring benefit to peopl who could no longer pay for insur becaus it will be good for the uninsur peopl to have a chanc to get health insur that is afford for them  provid health care for peopl that need it the govern is now help the what more import than your health and one need to have insur  becaus if a person is sick or dont have money how are they go to pay the bill  the law will help them get insur it is the right thing to do becaus is more access to peopl who cant afford it the fact that they are tri to save peopl money as far as the benefit premium are concern  i think health care right now is too expens and doesnt meet everyon need    becaus it more afford for the uninsur and i get treat better becaus it a lot of peopl that cant afford health care and im one of them it should help me with my medicin it help peopl who cannot afford insur everyon need to have health insur i think some of it kind of good i use to didnt have to pay a whole lot out of my pocket for it but now i do it chang a lot becaus the compani i work for make it favor becaus it has someth to do with help old peopl with health care and to help them get to see a doctor   i think old peopl should have it and not the young who can work   the health plan doe this  need to be a better system    help some peopl out it a start to health care to everyon becaus us hispan do not have health insur and we are legal worker and deserv to have insur the legisl that is associ with peopl uninsur the law is good that the govern the peopl to tri to get health care servic it would elimin  everyon could afford and get the proper coverag that is need it help peopl with no insur  everyon should have health care becaus i like what the presid is tri to do with the reform law  becaus we all need health coverag  otherwis  without the health care law  it realli expens  i think everybodi should be abl to have insur it is patient of adequ care due to insur compani and medicar becaus it gave me medicar coverag insur and i had not had health insur sinc i was  there is a need for everyon to have health insur it will allow peopl who are uninsur or pre exist condit to have insur becaus it cover way more peopl than ani other plan it is good for peopl with no health care   i feel the benefit are great  i think it is necessari in this countri becaus medic cost are too high   i believ that everyon should have the opportun to have health care well becaus everyon need health care and everi health care and some peopl can afford it and other peopl can but they refus to buy i feel it is import to offer cover to the uninsur  becaus we have million uninsur american and it too high  it will give the uninsur a better chanc to get health care becaus it help the low incom peopl  it a step to avail medic  i just feel like by do this it help peopl out more for health care it can help the poor who cannot afford insur to go to the doctor  it can help them get insur and their health can get better becaus it will help peopl  i like that they are tri to do someth for health care to make sure everybodi is cover becaus the new law improv the health care system  so mani and mother dont have insur we should tri to take care of everybodi we can   i just think everybodi should be insur i feel it go to help peopl who cant afford health care  health care will be more avail and afford to low incom famili  it cover more if that mean and children health coverag becaus i think we strong need the help and the uninsur that are sick are a burden to the tax payer and with the health law they can take care of themselv  it realli help out peopl without money pay their medic bill and get their medic treatment done  everybodi need health insur i think everyon should have health care  i believ everyon should have health care  it will benefit the million of american that dont have health insur to get coverag  step toward univers coverag becaus of the addit peopl that it cover everyon will have health care i feel that peopl easier access to health care i think it cover more than it did befor  more peopl that didnt have insur befor can now go to the doctor  lower cost of peopl cost of medic care and health care premium  i think a lot of peopl need health insur  insur compani have to pay for everyth becaus peopl need it im in the militari and i have health care and i think everyon els should have it too i have more children and a big famili and the coverag goe to age 26 and there is no for pre exist condit  becaus it will help low incom peopl and it will also help peopl who are realli sick and cant get medic treatment to be abl to get it i think peopl shouldnt be kick off their insur becaus of pre exist condit  the health care benefit is go toward all citizen becaus i support obama and he think someth is good for the peopl then im for it as well it move us in a better   health for all is  not be abl to be kick for health reason or get sick  im favor becaus if you have a pre exist condit they cannot turn you down for treatment it should be univers  free to all  becaus it affect my hous hold  in a countri as rich as our i cant believ peopl have no health care  and couldnt believ children had no health insur becaus of a preexist condit  good for everyon in the countri  it cover more peopl  it cover children  it fair  it the right thing to do  becaus it serv as back up for peopl who dont have health insur it give everyon health insur for those with no money   in order to keep the countri competit it is what we need just like social secur  and it long over due peopl need more  it cover everybodi and it lower premium for everybodi becaus it should help the futur  and be a mother of it should be import present health care in the unit state is in a and bad  too mani interest from the insur and pharmaceut compani  i guess  make sure everyth  it will help everyon not just the rich and even me   becaus it give everyon a chanc to have afford health care what we had befor was not work  someth has to be done to control the cost  singl payer option was remov so it cut cost reform is necessari  have to start somewher  dont think it went far enough  a singl issu becaus it was need to be done year ago and everybodi need to have access to health insur anyth is better than noth wish it gone   from what i know not have a cap on lifetim benefit becaus it was absolut necessari to keep the health insur compani under control  they were absolut us   we should the  the law that the  i think that peopl who do not have insur need to have some kind of coverag  and insur compani should not be abl to use pre exist condit against someon  it has cost my famili too much for insur premium now it is much better becaus i happen to one of those peopl to have a lot of health issu   it is go to take care of children so that they can get health care has to begin somewher  doesnt have to have everyth in it  over time will add more  get the kid cover compani cannot turn you away if your ill  it a good start  hard enough to get this one pass  to not  have everyon cover  w becaus the door is open for major reform  singl payer health care thing ive been get a lot  of free health care this year it make health more afford  and give it to more peopl  i am a senior and everi year they keep chang accomplish some need reform this is the first time that someon  is interest in fix it becaus i believ everyon should have health care insur peopl have lost job it seem to work for me  becaus if we dont do someth about those who dont have health care were go to have big problem as a whole  someth need to be done  we need to take care of everybodi in a countri such as our  everyon need health care  this is a step in the right direct well becaus im current unemploy and it will give those without ani benefit some benefit it make thing easier and cover more peopl  veri happi becaus it will take care of 30 million peopl   they would be cover becaus there is so mani peopl without job  help the elder  i think everyon in this countri has a right to health insur without go bankrupt my age insur cannot be deni for pre exist condit   children can stay on parent polici till age 26 person health issu  health need to be taken care of  it import everybodi has health care at my age  i use it quit a bit   my age is  it a step in the right direct becaus we have so mani peopl in the unit state who are uninsur  so let insur them it extend the age of young adult becaus we need it  we need to do someth  too mani peopl have sever health issu and them becaus they cannot afford to take care of themselv  inclus for peopl with exist condit not too  but i like it  it import that we have one  and the onli problem we dont have enough   we need some kind of health law  health insur is so high you cant afford it  it so expens that for me and my wife alon it over a month i think it keep peopl from be kick off the polici have ill and still keep insur everyon deserv some type of health care at a reason price  becaus we have to make sure everyon has health insur  peopl without should have insur  everyon should have health insur provid by feder govern  now more peopl will be on health insur children can stay on parent insur it is better than it was befor   the new system seem better  so everyon has insur allow major of peopl to have health care it the better chang and good  everybodi will have insur so peopl will stop use the er for free i dont have health insur right now i believ that everybodi should have health care  this chang will bring about a good chang in insur for everyon  everyon should have health care everybodi is entitl to have benefit with the way thing are go  the govern should allow everyon to have afford insur health care now is too expens   peopl need help in pay for health insur  becaus thing are so bad  peopl need to and get med  some of it will help peopl where they took out the pre exist condit i have a friend right now who can not get treatment to see how her cancer is and she doe not have health insur so someth has to be done i got kid it help give them help from the state  and it for everyon i am veri with this field  i have with insur compani and they run it and not the doctor  becaus it provid coverag to peopl who would have cap on overal coverag and a number of thing that it will be good for i think this will that we need much more comprehens health reform  becaus it will cover a lot of uninsur peopl  becaus i think that obama tri to get thing start but thing could be better weve onli the i have a son who is year old and have no health benefit  not a  student and he will have some benefit  i think it need to cover peopl that cant get insur  i am somewhat about it   tri to get health insur afford and to peopl that dont have it that need it i think it was long overdu and a step in the right direct  the favor part is the insur compani 80 to percent   unfavor is they did not go to the public option and the rise cost of health cost  when you get a test at doctor offic the cost is veri high  the health care system need to be reform that it wasnt work well the way it was befor becaus it doesnt allow doctor to just order thing on a that may not be necessari  for i feel like it tri to help to cut back of it given peopl who are unemploy an opportun for health are becaus they are make it avail to everyon it take import step in the right direct where we should be go i am insur by the state becaus i cant afford it and i would to have an to health care and im year old in need of health care i think it is about time they do someth about peopl out their insur cap and their pre exist condit  it import for everyon to have health care   we need someth done  it wasnt done in the previous administr peopl with prior ill cant be deni coverag anymor it was not a big issu for us they help the peopl on medicin and get the hole out  becaus it will provid coverag for those who have not had it avail in the past insur children at age 26  bring peopl from in home it got rid of cap make health care more afford and do what need to be done to make the health care work  it give benefit to peopl who never had them befor  i think it fair that everyon should receiv health care health care should be a right and not a  privileg  abl person should be abl to get health insur regardless of what  too mani peopl have through the and we need to correct  someth need to be done about pre exist  kid in colleg need to stay on insur  there are peopl who need help to maintain their health and help them is import in the govern  tri to get health care for everyon  weve need it for so long and it will help in the long run and i think that it will work out and it will be ok it is a step and is better than noth   just becaus i think we need a new health law for year  other countri have heath care for free except for the us becaus someth has to be done becaus it is a mess becaus of so mani differ reason it will help peopl who dont have health insur  i think it will help the less fortun and make sure everyon is avail to have health care becaus it help the averag person more than ani health bill has in year  it go to provid more coverag for more peopl  i think it help peopl who dont have insur right now put it through and it a lot of peopl do not have health insur i was laid off about month ago and with the new health reform law it took care of me it is a step in the right direct well becaus i think all american need to have health insur  becaus   peopl who will be cover that werent cover befor long overdu  has mani i like  they tri veri hard  it not perfect but it better than befor the person health issu in my famili and children be abl to get health insur is so veri import   becaus then there will not be a reason for peopl to get the proper care that they need when they get sick everyon will have insur and will be seen i believ it will eventu creat competit within the industri that will result in lower premium everi american should  be abl to have access to health care it will allow peopl like me to receiv health care from my parent till age 26  i feel as though everi american should have the right to health insur and be abl to see a doctor when need it make health care more afford  so that under privileg peopl like myself can have health insur and will not be for ani reason other than be it help peopl with insur to get the qualiti care they need i think this countri should be abl to afford health care for everyon i believ everi american should receiv health care coverag it provid health care for lower incom american who otherwis wouldnt be abl  becaus it will help more peopl in the long run instead of hurt them  a lot of peopl that need attent at a doctor offic or a hospit wont be turn away  give it a chanc it will help everyon obtain and keep health insur  i think this new law help everyon out it will benefit the lower class american who cant afford health care make sure everyon has adequ health care  everyon can get the care that they need everyon will have health care insur everyon will have health insur and i think it a great idea current   health care condit were  unafford in the countri i think some of the thing have been unfair and this will fix that becaus like my got by a and she doesnt have health care  her employ doe not offer health insur and her back is mess up becaus of it   becaus i was out on the for 2 year my wife doe not have insur and this will be a good chanc for her to get insur at a fair price  is a small first step in reform ineffici  expens  it is in the right direct    i guess becaus we need it need more peopl to buy their insur becaus it much need  someth was final done  this is an process i think everyon in the usa need health care someth better than noth becaus i believ everyon in u s  should have insur im a democrat and the presid is my be a long time come a lot of peopl are uninsur it is than the exist system becaus industri countri that doesnt have univers health care and that a basic right becaus it help as a citizen becaus i think chang is import i think it will help the poor down here in we dont ani hospit so the uninsur and the poor are suffer  the fact that colleg student can be in parent insur becaus the status   it is not work i think it doe away pre exist issu becaus it will help a lot of peopl i think theyr tri to get more health care for the underprivileg children are on the health insur for a longer amount of time becaus i own a busi we dont have insur and we pay out of our pocket and doctor us out of our money  someth bad happen i cant pay out of my pocket becaus it will help children and help peopl with insur compani that tri to cancel it when they need it the fact that it will give mandatori coverag to busi i think everybodi should have health care no matter what the last thing they did was to let you have your children  on your insur i think it will work with a few and peopl need it   i am a nurs and i work with peopl that are poor   no one is do anyth to help   and we need a system that meet the need of all peopl   not just the one who can pay for it i believ that everi american should the right to have health care  children are better protect becaus there are mani peopl who realli need health care it put some pressur on the insur compani just what i believ becaus everyon will have some type of health care becaus i think it will work if given the chanc question de salud que no  in question of health  some thing that they do not appli it will provid health care access to more american   with this new health care law i will be abl to receiv health care for a reason price becaus health care is someth that all american should be abl to afford no va a a todo y nos va ayudar salud  it doe not go to to all and it us goe to help to improv our health  becaus i want peopl who dont have insur to have insur  so there can be care for everyon la nos va ayudar a que todo a que todo tener y que  the new law us goe to help to that we all are treat equal to that we all have left to have medic coverag and that is good we should give it a chanc to work befor we it por que nos a ayudar a todo a tener seguro medico  help all to have medic insur becaus health reform will help peopl get insur senior citizen and children it will help those who are not as fortun enough to get health care    we need a chang in our nation health care system we need a system that all peopl can afford health insur no matter what their econom status is it will benefit all of us in the long run   it help out peopl who dont have insur to be abl to get the right medic need becaus it will help peopl get health insur at a low price becaus mani peopl in the u s  need a health reform law so they can afford health care becaus i think everybodi should have health care our old system is bankrupt our nation health care will be afford for my famili  becaus everybodi will have health care it help cover his kid when they get out of colleg  hope becaus of the health reform law everi one will have access to health care  chang to the donut whole need by a lot of peopl bad time becaus ive live all over the world and this is the place where we dont have a decent health care   everybodi should have the right to health care regardless   i think becaus everyon need health care i like the deduct and the kid are cover until the age the 26 becaus peopl need insur and peopl need health care i just thought it could be better everyon should have health care it not realli what i want but it a step and it a pretti good start there is some good thing in it at our age we never know when we will need it if everyon can get insur and medic treatment when they need it then we need the health care reform law for our countri it will benefit the averag hard work american who cant afford health care someth need to be done my age be a black american women  it great to have insur compani to with the govern  more control over the health care industri someth had to happen therefor i am not against it  they have the medic situat that are out of control the cost of medicin it has made good chang for some peopl  becaus of kid  it import they are insur becaus i dont have ani health care now  becaus the peopl will be insur there will be no of insur and there no limit this is veri import everybodi need health care and it veri expens and the citizen need help  becaus i have relat and friend that are not legal and dont have and i would like for them to have better job i think in my opinion we all should have health care in this countri   i dont even think you should have to work just to have it  it import end i think it is necessari for certain in the countri and i support the presid as a senior citizen it get rid of the donut hole  it help me it doesnt effect me it keep our 20 year old on our insur gent que no aseguransa y con gent tener de salud  the peopl who doe not have medic aseguransa and with this reform the peopl might have assist of health i think that basic idea is that everyon should have health  becaus i think the insur compani have been rip us off i think it help peopl who need help the old system was terribl  i am happi that we have a new law and i can keep my children on my plan with me  everyon has access to health care and peopl cannot be deni by health care provid and they cannot be kick off of health care becaus a lot of peopl dont have ani insur coverag and that the first thing that is ask at the hospit  i think everybodi deserv health care insur and i dont believ peopl with birth or pre condit should be deni i figur it about time somebodi got in offic and tri to up the mess the last presid left behind  chang is necessari in the health care system  and this is a step forward is a benefit for all children it could help someon that need the help becaus it benefit you direct becaus husband is disabl it help the poor and middl class i think it is give individu opportun to buy or too have health insur  becaus it is good for all peopl plus it depend if the peopl can afford it these day  mani of the issu effect the famili as a whole a child can stay on a health plan until he is 26 year child and the limit on the insur make sure everyon in the world have insur becaus it work for everybodi most becaus we can cover more peopl who  in the past  did not have health insur at all  all american deserv coverag  it will help peopl who do not current have health insur be abl to get health insur  not all peopl can have insur becaus im just happi someon is tri to fix it  becaus my has health issu and is effect by it children stay on parent insur till 26 year of age  and the compani cannot deni you insur becaus of your per exist condit  children are to be cover even if they have per exist condit s and i do believ it will bring done the cost of becaus need to now it just need to be some chang and thing have got out of control and it is too mani peopl without insur i like colleg student are insur until age 26 it is good for the public and poor peopl  becaus it help the peopl with pre exist condit as well as the senior afford their insur and help then to get their prescript at a more afford price everyon would have it but i feel like they should have some chang to it it is for peopl who dont have enough money to get the medic need that want health care has been avail in europ and i dont see whi it cant be avail here becaus all american need health care  the presid give those the opportun to get the health  peopl will get health benefit that they couldnt afford befor it put the countri on the right path for better health care  it not perfect but it get us go in the right direct becaus the health care and the economi was mess up befor obama got in offic i think he is tri his best to fix what was ruin   for the simpl fact that you have to start somewher and up on it   becaus it get a hold of the insur compani and stop them from just peopl for no reason and say pre exist condit and so on i think the health care reform has been need for some year now and it is about time it was start  it will help peopl a lot without insur i like that it stop from posit i like what is be present and everyon can be insur  it cover colleg student as myself to their educ and not have to burden themselv with insur premium  it allow me to stay on my parent insur  cut down on cost and also on peopl who cant afford insur i like what the law doe for senior citizen  it will provid more insur for more american becaus it help peopl who cant afford health insur it the first step that the govern has taken to help peopl to with health care i think someth has to be done to give health insur to everyon i believ in nation health care por que mucha gent que por  los y la gent que no seguro medico whi are mani peopl that there would benefit for her especi the children and the peopl who cannot buy insur do i medic peopl will get more assist than ever now at a cost we as a nation would be better with the health care reform becaus everybodi would have insur there been other countri that have had the nation health care plan  follow the foot step of other  it may be the best idea  and system receiv good care from govern so whi not health care   the major of our popul is go to need health care becaus of the i believ this countri is abl to afford take care of it peopl i favor it becaus even though it a new law it still has the to help us out  i see it work in our best interest  a lot of peopl are ill and mental issu and issu and we just need help   be put in a 3 by 5 is wrong  no  it just wrong  it address the need in our societi for access health care everybodi should have health care  everybodi should be help   it help more peopl when they need the help the most everyon should be abl to go to the doctor when they are sick think everyon should be requir to have health care becaus presid mess all that up when he was offic  peopl expect obama to a and it just and im happi hes work on it  veri
